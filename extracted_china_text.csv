2002,"Globalization—the growing integration of economies and societies around the world resulting from increased flows of trade, capital, people, and ideas— remains one of the most debated issues of our time. The World Bank has made important contributions to the discussion of globalization in the areas of research and ideas. In fiscal 2002 the Bank published the Policy Research Report Globalization, Growth, and Poverty: Building an Inclusive World Economy. The report summarized the findings pf a large-scale Bank research program on the various dimensions of globalization. The study found no evidence that there is growing inequality within thejtypical developing country that is opening up to the global economy. In fact, some of the fastest-growing locations in the world are places in the developing world that were extremely poor ,20 years ago but that have made serious efforts to integrate with the world market. Bangladesh, China, India, Uganda, and Vietnam are all examples of globalizing developing countries that have experienced unprece-"
2002,"The growing awareness that the efficient use of knowledge makes the Bank a more effective institution has led to the mainstreaming of capacity building in its operational work. For example, a “knowledge economy assessment tool” is being used to help countries diagnose their policy and investment needs as they enter the global economy. In fiscal 2002 knowledge assessments were completed for China and the Republic of Korea, and they are under way in the Russian Federation and EU accession countries."
2002,"The Global Development Learning Network (GDLN), a rapidly expanding network of distance-learning centers, uses videoconferencing and other technologies to share learning activities worldwide. Thirty-seven GDLN sites are now operating, and an additional 42 are under development. In China the distance-learning center hub in Beijing is linked with a regional center in Ningxia via a high-speed fiber network: the China Education and Research Network is creating a network of networks, reaching out to universities throughout China. WBI’s partnership with TEC de Monterrey in Mexico also provides access to more than 500 downlink points in Latin America and the Caribbean."
2002,"In addition to the World Bank, Founding Members of the Foundation include the governments of Australia, China, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mali (sponsored by the Netherlands), Pakistan, and Rwanda. Founding Members contribute at least $5 million (in cash or in kind) over a three-year period."
2002,"The percentage of the world’s population living on less than $1 per day fell from 29 percent in 1990 to 23 percent in 1999. However, almost all of the reduction in the number of people living in extreme poverty was in East Asia and Pacific, where China has made rapid progress. In Europe and Central Asia the number and proportion living in extreme poverty have increased. Elsewhere the poverty ratio has decreased, but the absolute number of people in dire poverty increased. The result has been little change in the number of poor people in the world—about 1.2 billion. And the number of people living on less than $2 per day, a more realistic poverty line in many countries, increased from 2.7 billion to 2.8 billion from 1990 to 1999."
2002,"More than 30 countries are benefiting from Bank financing for the adoption and expansion of the TB control strategy known as DOTS—directly observed treatment, short course. More specifically, the second TB Control Project in China builds on a previous operation that demonstrated the successful application of DOTS on a massive scale. This project is also innovative: it involves cofinancing from the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development to reduce the interest burden on the Chinese government. In addition, support for rolling back malaria through Bank operations includes some 45 active projects, and the Bank is helping to ensure malaria is a priority in its work through sectorwide approaches (SWAPs), PRSPs, the Comprehensive Development Framework, and HIPC."
2002,"A Business Primer Fund has also been set up to spur work on cross-sector issues. PSI has established partnerships with different country teams to enhance its support for the preparation of Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers. Such efforts are currently under way with poverty reduction strategies for the Democratic Republic of Congo, Cote d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, and Nigeria. The network is also coordinating upstream interventions in key CASs in China, Colombia, Mexico, Pakistan, the Philippines, the Russian Federation, and Thailand."
2002,"The East Asia and Pacific region was hard hit by the global economic downturn of 2001. Growth fell from over 7 percent to less than 5 percent. But a quicker and more robust regional recovery appeared to be under way by early 2002, supported by a stronger-than-expected recovery in major export markets like the United States and solid local private consumer spending. A more balanced recovery resting on increased exports and domestic demand seemed likely. Political stability improved as new governments in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand strengthened their mandates and their credibility with the public. China’s still-robust economy was pulling in imports at a near-10 percent pace in the first several months of 2002 and continued as a bright spot in the regional export and economic picture, enhanced by the anticipated impact of China’s entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), the increased pace of its institutional reform program, and its emergence as a key center of regional trade and investment flows."
2002,"The impact of the 2001 downturn on poverty in East Asia and Pacific was muted because growth fell most in countries with low poverty. Robust growth in China and other transition countries, which contain the large majority of the region’s poor, helped offset any widening income disparities. Still, a sustained regional recovery is important to counter the long-term trend of slow poverty reduction since the mid-1990s—and to ensure that countries in East Asia remain on track to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)."

2002,"Domestic business revitalization and recovery in private capital flows call for more emphasis on strengthening the investment climate. The Bank is preparing a legal reform loan in Mongolia and is undertaking legal needs assessments in a number of countries, including Vietnam. In China the Bank is providing technical assistance on financial sector reform, access by small and medium enterprises to financial services, government bond market development, and securities market regulation—reforms made all the more urgent by China’s accession to the WTO."
2002,"To help regional competitiveness and to meet high-tech challenges, the Bank is investing in information infrastructure, technology innovation and adaptation, and skills development. It is sponsoring country Innovation Days as part of the global Development Marketplace—a competition encouraging innovation and creative partnerships among nongovernmental organizations, businesses, and government. In Thailand it is funding 16 proposals to increase access to information services in rural communities in order to help bridge the urban-rural digital divide. A new report analyzes the Republic of Korea’s experience with firm innovation and its implications for public policy. The Bank carried out assessments of transportation and logistics in Cambodia, and in lagging regions of China, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Mongolia, and Vietnam, to identify ways to improve access to markets for low-income areas."
2002,"The Bank’s governance work focuses on decentralization, building subnational capacity, increasing public sector transparency and accountability, and fostering stakeholder participation in project design and implementation. Public expenditure reviews at the local government level are taking place in China and Indonesia. In Thailand the Country Development Partnership in Governance supports government efforts to improve the delivery of public services, strengthen government decisionmaking, and promote accountability and transparency."
2002,In China the Bank is working with the government to update the Ministry of Finance’s competitive bidding guidelines by introducing fraud and anticorruption measures. It is also helping to improve

In China the Bank has embarked on a unique partnership with DfID, the British government aid arm, to finance a tuberculosis (TB) control project aimed at helping China meet its global TB targets by 2005 by expanding directly observed treatment, short course (DOTS) to at least 90 percent of the country’s population and identifying and treating 2 million infections."
2002,"The Bank has also been channeling support to areas of extreme poverty. In Indonesia, to improve road conditions in its lagging eastern region, a regional transportation project will serve 15 provinces in the eastern islands. In Vietnam the Rural Electrification Project aims to bring electricity to 2 million people in 32 provinces and 671 communities, one-third of which are designated as the poorest. A Global Development Learning Center has been opened in Ningxia to transfer knowledge to one of the poorest parts of China."

2002,"Developed countries acknowledge that they must provide more and better aid, improve policy coherence, and, critically, move forward on trade policies in support of development.

2002,"The Monterrey Consensus was a historic step forward. At last developing countries saw the promise of a turnaround in the access to trade and in the volume of aid, as an additional $12 billion was pledged by donor countries over the next three years. The challenge before us now is to translate the new global development partnership into action, redoubling our efforts on the part of developing countries and the broader international community."
2002,"The Bank addresses global issues where common action can alleviate adverse conditions that all developing countries share. Five areas requiring specific attention are communicable diseases, the environment, trade and integration, information and knowledge, and international financial architecture. Communicable disease priorities include fighting human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), tuberculosis, malaria, and childhood diseases, as well as promoting vaccines and drug development to combat major communicable diseases. Environmental priorities include addressing climate change, access to water, protection of forests, biodiversity, ozone depletion, and land degradation; and promoting agricultural research. Trade activities aspire to help make the world trading system more conducive to development by promoting market access by developing countries and fostering their effective participation"
2002,"in global and regional trade negotiations. At the national level, activities are aimed at helping developing countries harness trade by integrating pro-poor reforms into their national development and poverty reduction strategies. (See box 1.1, Globalization and Trade.) Information and knowledge priorities include redressing the digital divide and equipping countries with the capacity to access knowledge, and promoting the understanding of development and poverty reduction. Financial architecture includes developing international standards, financial stability, and international accounting and legal frameworks."
2002,BOX 1.1 GLOBALIZATION AND TRADE
2002,"Globalization—the growing integration of economies and societies around the world resulting from increased flows of trade, capital, people, and ideas— remains one of the most debated issues of our time. The World Bank has made important contributions to the discussion of globalization in the areas of research and ideas. In fiscal 2002 the Bank published the Policy Research Report Globalization, Growth, and Poverty: Building an Inclusive World Economy.

Bangladesh, China, India, Uganda, and Vietnam are all examples of globalizing developing countries that have experienced unprece-"
2002,"Two of the research findings from the Bank's work on globalization have shed light on crucial tasks that would enable more poor countries to participate in and benefit from globalization. This has helped sharpen the institution's strategic focus. The first issue is the improvement of the investment climate. Many developing countries have carried out first-generation reforms, including liberalization of formal trade policies. The locations that benefit the most from these reforms are those that have reasonably good investment climates: a regulatory environment in which firms can start up, increase productivity, and expand; efficient public services, such as customs administration; and complementary infrastructure, such as power, ports, and telecommunications—services that can be provided by the private sector given a proper legal and regulatory framework."
2002,"A second important issue that has been highlighted by the work on globalization concerns social services and social protection. Integration with the global economy leads developing countries to grow faster because it creates a more dynamic environment in which there is greater competition and entry and exit of firms. But this dynamism has a clear social cost: there will be more turnover in the labor market, highlighting the need for good social protection. Furthermore, the jobs created in developing countries as a result of foreign trade and investment will generally have higher skill requirements than most existing jobs. This upgrading can be a powerful force for aggregate productivity growth, but it is crucially important that it be supported by a good educational system and that the poor, in particular, have good access to basic education."
2002,The Global Arcnitecture ot Trade
2002,"An important role for the Bank is trade advocacy on behalf of developing countries. While developed countries have low trade protection, on average, the areas where they maintain protection are exactly the sectors where poor countries are potentially competitive, namely agriculture and labor-intensive manufactures. These sectors confront the greatest trade barriers, putting the world's poor at a particular disadvantage. According to estimates in the Bank's Global Economic Prospects 2002, the average poor person selling into globalized markets confronts barriers that are roughly twice as high as those facing the typical nonpoor worker. In general, tariffs in high-income countries on imports"
2002,"The Bank's research has highlighted the cost to developing countries of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development protection of textiles and garments, and subsidies to agriculture. It also points out the potential costs to developing countries from the TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) Agreement, which requires 20-year patents on pharmaceutical products and imposes new legal and administrative costs on developing countries. The Bank has called for better market access by poor countries and for reform of TRIPS implementation to ensure access of poor countries to essential drugs."
2002,"Protection is not an issue solely for high-income countries, however. Developing countries have also placed high barriers on agricultural products, laborintensive manufactured goods, and other products and services. Developing-country tariffs in manufacturing are, on average, four times higher for imports from developing countries than are tariffs in industrial countries on imports from developing countries. Also, restrictions on services trade are usually more common in developing countries than in industrial countries."
2002,"Global Economic Prospects 2002 makes a case for reshaping the global architecture of world trade to promote development and poverty reduction by focusing on four policies: using the World Trade Organization (WTO) ministerial to launch a development round of trade negotiations that would reduce global trade barriers; engaging in global collective action to promote trade outside the negotiating framework of the WTO, including increasing multilateral aid-for-trade assistance; adopting protrade development policies of high-income countries unilaterally; and enacting new trade reforms in developing countries. Some 2.8 billion people live on less than $2 a day. The current projected baseline growth could reduce poverty by 600 million to"
2002,"2.2	billion by 2015. The report argues that seizing the opportunity to reshape the global trade architecture in this way would enable developing countries to grow at rates that could reduce such poverty to 1.9 billion by 2015, effectively lifting an additional 300 million people above the $2-a-day poverty line."
2002,"Adjustment loans provide quick-disbursing external financing to support policy and institutional reforms. Adjustment loans were originally designed to provide short-term balance of payments support for macroeconomic policy reforms, including reforms in trade policy. Over time they have evolved to focus more on medium-term structural and institutional reforms in the financial sector, social policy, and public sector resource management."
2002,"■	In March 2002 more than 50 heads of state gathered in Monterrey, Mexico, at the Financing for Development Conference, where they adopted the Monterrey Consensus, which calls for freeing trade, increasing aid, and reducing external debt to sustainable levels in order to provide countries that follow sound policies and good governance with the means to obtain the Millennium Development Goals. An additional $12 billion in aid over the next three years was pledged by donor countries at the conference."

2002,"The Bank has worked with partners to divide responsibility for some diagnostic ESW at the country level, and to enable joint preparation and wider dissemination of the diagnostic work. Particular emphasis in fiscal 2002 was placed on trade, the investment climate, the MDGs, cross-country benchmarking,"
2002,"and basic service delivery (to be examined in World Development Report 2004). Joint programs are being carried out between the Private Sector Development and Infrastructure Network and the Development Economics and Data Group (DECDG) on trade, the Human Development Network and DECDG on the MDGs, and among the Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Network, the World Bank Institute (WBI), and DECDG on PRSPs and other cross-sectoral issues."
2002,"ment favors aid effectiveness and where the Bank’s presence will have a high impact. To address the needs of countries with weak institutions and poor policy environments where development assistance is urgently needed but likely to have little impact, the Bank is exploring ways to adapt its assistance instruments to countries’ specific needs. Corporate advocacy priorities help the Bank to incorporate the twin pillars of its development strategy into its country level work. Selectivity at the global level reflects the Bank’s global public goods priorities: communicable diseases, the environment, trade and integration, information and knowledge, and international financial architecture. The Bank’s Global Public Goods Incentive Fund, launched in 2001, helped to achieve a stronger link between global and country programs. Box 2.2 describes the Bank’s CDF."
2002,"The partnership with OECD has deepened and broadened considerably in recent years, with the objective of maximizing complementary activities and synergies and minimizing duplication. Collaboration with the organization’s DAC has been an especially important focus of this partnership. DAC provides a forum for OECD members to achieve, as bilateral donors, greater coherence and convergence in their development programs. The DAC Guidelines on Poverty Reduction have been the basis for the remarkable degree of convergence and consensus among the bilateral donors for the CDF-PRSP approach, who have expressed an intention to align aid programs within the PRSP framework and to untie their aid to least-developed countries. Beyond low-income countries, the Bank collaborates with the OECD on a broad agenda including trade, environment, corporate governance, anticorruption, and the"
2002,"But not all developing countries have enjoyed such progress. For example, Africa as a region saw no increase in its overall per capita income between 1965 and 1999, despite significant improvements in certain social indicators. And in Africa and elsewhere, too many countries have suffered deteriorations in economic and social conditions over long periods. The challenges are not just economic and technical but also political, social, institutional, and financial. Even in numerous countries that have worked hard to reform policies (for example, by achieving macroeconomic stability and increasing openness and competition), an unfinished agenda in governance and institutional reform has hampered economic growth and limited poverty reduction. External factors such as Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) agricultural subsidies and trade barriers have impeded developing countries’ efforts to integrate and develop. Mistakes by the donor community—such"
2002,"The magnitude of the challenge as articulated in the MDGs is daunting and will continue to grow as developing countries’ populations grow by an estimated 2 billion over the next 30 years. A new international commitment and increased understanding of development effectiveness means that the scale of response can rise to meet the challenge. The response, as articulated in the Monterrey Consensus, involves reforms in developing countries themselves as well as in the international economy, particularly in the areas of trade and aid."
2002,"Sustained economic growth remains critical for poverty reduction. Without it, poor people’s prospects for greater opportunity, empowerment, and security— essential elements of the strategy for poverty reduction described in the World Development Report 2000/2001—will be harder to realize. Thus growth is a necessary condition for attacking poverty—but it is not a sufficient one. Bank poverty reduction activities therefore extend beyond supporting growth in member countries to fostering poor countries’ leadership in poverty reduction strategy making, addressing gender inequalities, investing in poor people and empowering them, supporting key aspects of good governance and institutional reform, and helping countries participate effectively in the global trading system. Highlights of activities in these areas during fiscal 2002 included conducting (jointly with the International Monetary Fund [IMF]) a comprehensive review of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) approach, launching a strategy to integrate gender into the mainstream of Bank lending and nonlending work, and designing a framework for empowerment strategies. Meanwhile, responding to the challenge of the World Trade Organization (WTO) ministerial meeting in Doha, Qatar, the Bank stepped up its efforts to help developing countries benefit from the world trade system."
2002,TRADE
2002,"While openness to trade can be an important spur to growth, trade liberalization alone is insufficient for generating widely shared income gains. The Bank’s trade-related activities seek to improve understanding of the conditions that lead from openness to growth and poverty reduction, and to help integrate development considerations into international collective actions on trade—and trade into development strategies (see box 4.2)."
2002,"At the country level the Bank seeks to help developing countries respond to new market opportunities. The challenge is to integrate trade reforms into national development strategies that support growth and poverty reduction. The Bank also provides direct advice and capacity building, including for WTO accession negotiation. In June 2002 the Bank published Development, Trade, and the WTO: A Handbook."

For example, Global Economic Prospects 2002, released in November 2001, and the Policy Research Report Globalization, Growth and Poverty: Building an Inclusive World Economy have helped shape the global trade debate and the agenda set at the WTO ministerial meeting in Doha, Qatar. Trade work is based on a strengthened program of technical research, focused on a better understanding of how institutional and regulatory reforms affect trade and investment liberalization; provision of an analytical framework to help developing countries set priorities for reform and multilateral trade negotiations; analysis of how trade policy reforms and domestic institutions can together help to reduce poverty; and work to make the global trading system more transparent and more attuned to the needs of developing countries."
2002,"The World Bank, as tljie largest lender for sustainable development, isifully committed to the goals of the WSSD, held in Johannesburg, South Africa, August 26 to September 4, 2002. During fiscal 2002 the World Bank supported the preparatory process of the Summit. Based on the common platform of achieving the MDGs, the WSSD was a unique opportunity to move'jthe sustainable development agenda closer to implementation, adding coherence to the gains coming out of the Financing for Development conference in Monterrey, Mexico, and the Doha, Qatar.i conference on Trade and Development."
2002,Trade and Integration
2002,"Regional integration in Africa is seen as one approach to creating a larger economic space with more opportunities for investors and entrepreneurs. The Bank is supporting regional efforts to create integrated markets and initiatives aimed at increasing cooperation to address common issues in a regional context, such as with the Nile Basin Initiative. Two regional IDA operations became effective in fiscal 2002: a $9.4 million project to strengthen payments systems in the West Africa Economic and Monetary Union, and a $5 million trade facilitation project in East Africa."
2002,"The Bank has been a fervent advocate for a fairer post-Doha trade system, urging industrial countries to increasingly open their markets to African products. The Bank has also provided technical support to African countries in trade negotiations."
2002,"The East Asia and Pacific region was hard hit by the global economic downturn of 2001. Growth fell from over 7 percent to less than 5 percent. But a quicker and more robust regional recovery appeared to be under way by early 2002, supported by a stronger-than-expected recovery in major export markets like the United States and solid local private consumer spending.

2002,"The Bank’s focus in South Asia has continued to be on supporting sustainable reforms: fiscal consolidation, privatization, trade liberalization, and banking reform; establishing transparency, effectiveness, and accountability of public institutions; and supporting the expansion of services to the poor. Bank lending is based on an extensive program of analytical work in the form of reports, workshops, policy notes, and ongoing policy dialogue."
2002,Supporting Trade and Integration
2002,"There are substantial untapped opportunities for cooperation in many of Europe and Central Asia’s subregions. Together with the European Commission, Europe and Central Asia programs provide support to EU accession candidates on numerous subregional activities, including transportation, environment, energy, and knowledge economy strategies. Analytical work on trade issues has also been undertaken for the countries of Southeast Europe that are not EU accession candidates, including five country studies, a regional report in progress, and technical assistance. In the CIS-7, studies of trade, transportation, and telecommunications have been carried out. Bank support for trade integration in Russia and Ukraine is focusing on technical assistance for WTO accession."
2002,A decline in the growth of world trade and drops in export commodity prices reduced Latin America and the Caribbean’s export revenue growth to
2002,"1.4	percent in 2001, after a 19 percent rise in 2000. The trade surpluses of oil exporters decreased, but trade balances increased in other countries in the region as they imported less due to slower GDP growth. Overall, the region’s trade surplus increased by $17 billion, while the current account deficit widened by $5 billion as a result of lower receipts from tourism and remittances."
2002,"Natural resources are an asset for countries in Latin America and the Caribbean seeking to create high-quality jobs in the knowledge economy, according to a World Bank study. Despite recent stagnation of prices for many primary commodities and some disquieting trends in job quality and unemployment in the region, From Natural Resources to the Knowledge Economy— Trade and Job Quality presents evidence that, ""rich endowments of natural resources, combined with aggressive pursuit and adoption of more productive technologies, are a proven growth recipe."""
2002,"Citing experiences in countries including Australia, Canada, Finland, and some Latin American countries, the report argues that it is not so much what is produced, but how it is produced. The critical complementary ingredients are high levels of human capital and knowledge networks that generate innovation and adoption of foreign technologies. The region's countries, it recommends, should pursue trade openness, develop human capital and innovation networks, and ""not turn their backs on their natural wealth."""
2002,"private sector development becoming a prime source of job creation, the Bank has worked extensively to improve the investment climate in the region. Projects and advisory services to strengthen financial sectors in Algeria and the Republic of Yemen; trade and competitiveness in Tunisia; private sector development in Algeria; and information technology in the West Bank and Gaza, Tunisia, and the Republic of Yemen are good examples. The weight of the public sector and governance issues also constitutes a serious impediment to more rapid growth. Work in fiscal 2002 has focused on improving public expenditure efficiency and public sector management in Algeria, Djibouti, Jordan, and Morocco, and decentralization in Algeria, Jordan, Tunisia, and the Republic of Yemen."

They stressed that long term debt sustainability will depend upon the maintenance of sound economic policies, strengthened debt management and the provision of appropriate financing. With regard to recent events, they noted that the enhanced HIPC initiative framework provides for the consideration of additional assistance at the completion point if there has been a fundamental change in a country’s economic circumstances due to exceptional exogenous shocks. The Committee recognized the need to take into account worsening global growth prospects and declines in terms of trade, when updating HIPC initiative debt sustainability analysis at completion point. Ministers noted that the relevant operational procedures for exercising such an option were recently approved by the Bank and Fund Boards. Ministers also reiterated the importance of fully financing the enhanced HIPC Initiative and urged bilateral donors to fulfill this commitment.

In this connection, the Committee warmly welcomed the decision reached by the WTO last week in Doha to launch a new round of trade negotiations. They endorsed the WTO Ministerial Declaration’s aim to place the needs and interests of developing countries at the heart of their Work Programme. Ministers emphasized the importance of countries integrating trade into their development strategies and improving their investment regulations, standards and technical regulations, removing obstacles to efficient transport of goods and materials, and strengthening telecommunications and business services. Ministers noted that greater access to markets would provide a major boost to development. They also stressed the priority they attach to helping developing countries strengthen their capacity to respond to market opportunities and to implement trade-related agreements."
2002,"7.	Economic growth requires a strong and vibrant private sector and an enabling climate that encourages investment, entrepreneurship and job creation. However, it is not enough to strengthen the private sector in developing countries without further progress in integrating them into the global trading system. We thus strongly endorsed the call at Monterrey for coherence between development assistance and trade policies. We urged an acceleration of efforts to lower trade barriers (including trade distorting subsidies) and we called upon the Bank and others to provide more support in helping developing countries address policy, institutional, social and infrastructure impediments limiting their ability to share in the benefits of trade."
2002,"At June 30, 2002, $103,604 million (58%) of the uncalled capital was callable from the member countries of IBRD that are also members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). This amount was equal to 93.2% of IBRD’s outstanding borrowings after swaps at June 30,"
2002,"Development Credits: IDA’s development credits have a significant grant element because of the concessional nature of IDA's terms. Discounting the future cash flows from IDA’s development credits using government reference rates represented by interest rates of government securities having similar maturity to the portfolio of development credits, provides an estimate for the grant element. Under the Original HIPC Debt Initiative, development credits identified for sale to the HIPC Debt Initiative Trust Fund are written down to their estimated net present value using currency specific Commercial Interest Reference Rates (CIRRs) published monthly by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Using the six months average CIRR as a discount rate provides an alternative estimate for the grant element."

2003,"East Asia’s growth was 6.7 percent, fueled by China’s growth of 8 percent and conducive policies in other countries. At the other end of the spectrum, gross domestic product (GDP) growth in Latin America and the Caribbean dropped by 0.8 percent because of the banking collapse and government debt default in Argentina, uncertainty regarding Brazilian elections, a worsening of conditions in the Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela, and a decrease of over $30 billion in financial market flows. In Europe and Central Asia, growth was 4.6 percent, resulting from a sharp recovery of activity in Turkey following its 2001 crisis, as well as continued gains linked to higher oil prices in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States countries. The continued strength of domestic demand in India led to gains of 4.2 percent in South Asia, despite the disruptions in regional conditions associated with the war on terrorism. Growth in Africa and in the Middle East and North Africa was sluggish, with the"

Thus, one aspect of the Bank’s work is to measure the investment climate objectively and link it to firm performance so that countries (and cities within countries) can gauge their progress and identify priority areas for reform."
2003,"The Global Development Learning Network (www.gdln.org) represents a growing partnership of public and private organizations committed to development and poverty reduction. In more than 50 distance learning centers around the world, partners use interactive technologies for knowledge sharing, coordinating, consulting, and training with the goal of capacity building. Recently the network provided a forum on the stigma and discrimination related to HIV/AIDS for decisionmakers and community leaders across regions. The forum enabled participants in Barbados, China, Moldova, Tanzania, Thailand, and Uganda to address the challenges of living with HIV/AIDS and to explore various initiatives to raise awareness and combat discrimination."
2003,"In fiscal 2003 WBI adopted a country-focused business model, customizing its capacity-building programs to countries’ priority needs, applying best-practice pedagogy, maintaining a sustained presence at the country level, and collaborating with key figures who can implement policy decisions. The Bank identified 41 countries for customized learning and knowledge programs. Among them were Afghanistan, Somalia, and Sudan, where knowledge and learning activities dominate the Bank’s engagement strategy; Albania, Kenya, and the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, where learning programs are particularly important to complement and support other Bank activities; and Brazil, China, and India, large countries where many people live in poverty and where there is a strong demand for strategic management of the knowledge economy."
2003,"2003	was robust lending to Latin America, with $5.7 billion or 50 percent of total lending, followed by Europe and Central Asia with $2 billion and East Asia and Pacific with $1.8 billion. Lending was not as concentrated as it was in fiscal 2002. Whereas only two countries, Brazil and Turkey, made up roughly 45 percent of total lending last year, 5 countries, including Argentina, Brazil, China, Colombia, and Mexico had a combined commitment volume equaling 49 percent of total lending in fiscal 2003."

2003,"The Financial Sector Learning Program, a well-developed unit of the World Bank Institute, emphasizes policy dialogue and collaborative problem solving by participants. These activities take the form of conferences, regional and global workshops, and distance learning through videoconferencing and the Internet. As an excellent example of using first-hand research and creative knowledge tools, the Learning Program has followed up the joint World Bank-International Monetary Fund publication, Developing Government Bond Markets: A Handbook, with a series of regional hands-on seminars both for senior officials responsible for developing government bond markets and for individuals responsible for operating the bond markets. To date, regional workshops have been held in Brazil, China, Tunisia, and Turkey, serving to deliver research and policy advice to our client-country authorities who can use it to strengthen their financial systems. (See www.worldbank.org/wbi/banking.)"
2003,"Five years after the financial crisis, East Asia has reestablished itself as the fastest growing region in the world. Growth rose more than 2 percentage points in 2002 to 6.7 percent—a surprisingly robust rate given the slow pace of global recovery and high levels of uncertainty in the world economy. China continued to emerge as a key regional locomotive, growing by 8 percent and attracting nearly 40 percent of the growth in exports of other East Asian economies."
2003,"Investment Climate Assessments, under way in Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, the Philippines, and Thailand, aim at improving the institutional environment for private investment and identifying reforms that will lead to higher productivity, more efficient firms, and ultimately more job creation. In Mongolia a legal reform project is supporting the establishment of an administrative court system, capacity building for legal and judicial information, and legal education.

To assist the region in meeting high-tech challenges of an increasingly competitive world, a new study, Innovative East Asia: the Future of Growth, offers a set of policy measures for developing and strengthening innovative capabilities. The Global Development Learning Network (GDLN) provides regional and country-specific knowledge programs in 14 centers throughout Asia. And a new initiative, InfoCity, has been building electronic networks among city governments in the Philippines—and expanding to China and Indonesia—to foster partnerships and exchange the latest practices and innovations for city management."
2003,"The Philippines Social Fund for Peace and Development Project is working to foster lasting development in Mindanao by providing support to implement community projects and by involving the groups most affected by the ongoing conflict. In Mongolia the Sustainable Livelihoods Project is helping tackle poverty among the country’s rural nomads (41 percent of the population) by expanding their access to financing, providing small-scale investment in infrastructure, and assisting with pastoral risk management. And in China, where tuberculosis is the leading infectious cause of death, the Bank is helping finance an expansion of the national tuberculosis control program to reach more of the poor, who are disproportionately affected by the disease."
2003,"The Bank integrates environmental components into much of its lending in rural, urban, water, and energy sectors. Furthermore, the Bank has forestry management programs under way in Cambodia, China, Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands, and provides policy advice to Indonesia.

2003,"In FY 2003, IBRD's Executive Directors approved a policy that, under certain circumstances, would allow IBRD to continue lending to borrowers that had reached the concentration risk limit. Under this policy, borrowers may exceed this limit provided they have entered into an arrangement designed to insulate IBRD from possible cash flow losses resulting from exposure in excess of the concentration risk limit. Application of this policy would therefore not increase IBRD’s net exposure to a borrower. Any such arrangement that would permit the gross exposure to a borrower to exceed the concentration risk limit would need to be approved in advance by IBRD's Executive Directors. During FY 2003, IBRD entered into the first such arrangement with one borrower, China. As of June 30, 2003, China had not exceeded the concentration risk limit."
2003,"Monterrey underscored the central importance of trade in attaining the MDGs. At the Doha meeting on trade last year, the international community made a commitment to collective action that holds the promise of truly integrating trade with development."
2003,"As we approach the halfway mark of the Doha Round, the challenge of translating that commitment into concrete results looms large. Agriculture is the most crucial and most difficult issue on the agenda—and market restrictions and subsidies in agriculture are the most important external impediments to tackling poverty in the developing countries. In fact, the amounts of aid needed globally by all the developing countries to reach the MDGs represent a fraction of what is spent on agricultural subsidies by developed countries. Action on the trade agenda is a top priority for the international community."

In response to the DC request, Bank and Fund staff, working in consultation with the staff of the U.N., other multilateral development banks (MDBs), the World Trade Organization (WTO), and the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), have designed a monitoring framework and carried out an initial application of that framework."
2003,"A systematic effort has been under way to strengthen collaboration on the non-DAC agenda as well. Priorities include governance and public sector management, tax policy and administration, trade, corporate governance, sustainable development, agriculture, and the knowledge economy. The Bank and OECD together with the IMF also have launched an International Tax Dialogue aimed at sharing experience and fostering multilateral communication on tax systems."
2003,"The EU provides 55 percent of the total official development assistance in the world—more than $26 billion in 2001—and is the developing world’s most important trading partner, absorbing 21 percent of its exports and extending preferential arrangements to developing regions. Expected to take in 10 new member states—or 100 million more people—in 2004, the EU works toward political and economic reform and poverty reduction in the world, especially in neighboring regions such as the Middle East and North Africa, with which it has active trade, investment, and migration links."

2003,"2004.	This forecast partly reflects the end of crisis conditions in several countries where output was severely compressed in 2002. But it is also founded on a number of crucial assumptions about the conditions facing developing countries, including some disruptions from military action in Iraq but no severe, lasting effects; the expansion of world trade by 4.6 percent in 2003 (double the 2.3 percent growth in global GDP); and a slight rebound in the flows of foreign direct investment as well as in modestly positive net debt flows from private sources."
2003,"In recent years core diagnostic work has been a fairly constant share of the Bank’s ESW program, reflecting the high priority assigned to this product line (see table 2.1). At the same time there has been a pronounced shift from other diagnostic and advisory reports to informal products, the result of an increased emphasis in Bank work on capacity building, knowledge dissemination, and the provision of“just-in-time” advice to clients. Financial and private sector development, public sector governance, and economic management were themes with the largest share of total ESW output in fiscal 2003. The Bank also carried out substantial ESW focusing on human development, social protection, risk management, trade, and rural development, which help provide the diagnostic bases for project design and country programming. More than 25 percent of the fiscal 2003 program was delivered by Africa, followed by Europe and Central Asia (24 percent), and East Asia and the Pacific (14 percent). Country reports were supplemented by regional reports concentrating on such issues as regional"

ESW is being more tightly integrated into the overall country assistance program, with increasing emphasis on country ownership, participatory processes, partnerships, and capacity building. For example, the Middle East and North Africa region and East Asia and the Pacific focused systematically on programmatic ESW, and the Middle East and North Africa deepened its involvement in the reimbursable Technical Cooperation Program along with its existing and more traditional ESW portfolio. In fiscal 2003,"

Regional outreach has included an initiative in Africa for trade unions and regional poverty forums in the Commonwealth of Independent States-7 (CIS-7) and the Balkans. Dissemination of guidance on the PRSP approach has included extensive distribution of the PRSP Good Practice pamphlet, updating of the PRSP Sourcebook, and development of the Attacking Poverty course for Bank staff.

During fiscal 2003, the Bank and other donors have supported PSIA activities within the PRSP process in 20 countries. The Bank has also employed PSIA in its own work, initially concentrating on PRSCs. (See www.worldbank.org/psia.)"
2003,TRADE
2003,"The Bank’s primary objectives on international trade are to promote a world trading system that is more conducive to economic development and to assist countries in capturing the benefits of global opportunities. Evidence suggests that increased trade raises productivity, and hence growth, which in turn is key for reducing poverty. In fiscal 2003 the Bank created a new Trade Department. This action substantially increased the Bank’s capacity, activities, and engagements in trade. It led to strengthened partnerships with international organizations, the increased publication of research relevant to the pro-development trade agenda, and intensified efforts to integrate trade into country and regional strategies such as the PRSP."
2003,"With the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the Bank is the main coordinating and implementing agency for the Integrated Framework (IF) Initiative, and it plays a key role in advancing the program (see box 4.1). Much of the Bank’s global effort on trade this year is directed toward the next milestone in the international trade arena—the WTO Ministerial meeting in Cancun in September 2003—that will review progress on the development agenda launched at the Doha Ministerial meeting in 2001."
2003,"The Bank provided support to key actors in the global trading system, including studies on the impact of trade and services liberalization on income distribution for Brazil; an analysis of WTO accession implications for Russia; and assistance to India on the design of a collaborative program on WTO-related issues such as services. Capacity-building activities were delivered through the World Bank Institute (WBI) to help countries analyze the economic implications of national trade policies and regulatory frameworks and to assist policymakers in formulating domestic trade reform agendas and international negotiating strategies. The Bank is expanding its assistance to low-income countries not eligible for the IF through, in the first instance, diagnostic trade studies that cover both the border and “behind-the-border” (that is, internal impediments) trade agendas."
2003,Two aspects of the behind-the-border agenda to which the Bank has been paying increasing attention are trade facilitation and compliance with
2003,"The Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to Least-Developed Countries assists these countries in expanding their participation in the global economy. Participating agencies are the IMF, the International Trade Center, UNCTAD, the United Nations Development Programme, the World Bank, and the WTO. The Bank and country stakeholders play lead roles during the diagnostic phase, when country constraints to integration into the global economy are analyzed and technical assistance needs are identified and prioritized. The analysis examines external and domestic investment climate factors as well as a country's institutional capacity for trade policy formulation, strategy, and development."
2003,"In fiscal 2003 the Integrated Framework Steering Committee extended the IF to Burundi, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Guinea, Lesotho, Mali, Nepal, Senegal, and the Republic of Yemen. In addition, participating countries such as Cambodia and Lesotho held programmatic discussions with donors, and Ethiopia, Malawi, and Nepal are planning national workshops to validate results of IF analysis. Finally, Burundi and Mali are in the process of analyzing key constraints to trade integration."
2003,"international product standards. Bank support for trade facilitation includes both analytical work and lending operations. Lending for trade facilitation makes up by far the largest amount of Bank trade lending. During the last two fiscal years, lending to support trade facilitation—including lending for institution building and physical infrastructure and for trade financing—made up 86 percent of total Bank lending to trade. The Bank has been increasing its support for client-country capacity building in standards development and implementation both at the country level (through lending operations) and at the cross-country level (such as through the launching of a Standards and Trade Development Facility with the WTO, the World Health Organization, and the Food and Agriculture Organization)."

2003,"During the past year, demand continued for training dealing with the practical aspects of international trade law and policy in such matters as market access, antidumping, countervailing measures, the General Agreement on Trade in Services, trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights, regional integration, environment, and labor standards, as well as dispute-settlement mechanisms in the WTO. Among other related seminars, the Bank sponsored an Afro-Latin Seminar on International Trade Law and Policy in December 2002. This distance learning program was carried out in partnership with the WBI, the International Law Institute, the Uganda African Center of Legal Excellence, and the Funda^ao Getulio Vargas of Brazil. It linked approximately 90 participants in Kampala, Paris, Sao Paulo, Vienna, and Washington, D.C. Led by world trade law experts, participants shared knowledge on international trade law and policy and explored new areas for Bank operational work, including relevant legal reform activity."
2003,Transportation and Trade
2003,Transportation is a critical element of trade competitiveness. In March 2003 the transportation sector and the Trade Group of the Bank’s Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Network agreed to establish a joint Transport and Trade Facilitation Task Force. The Task Force was developed to help the Bank address the issues identified by the WTO as priorities in the Doha Development Agenda. This joint unit will help client nations identify and take action to alleviate the constraints to wider external trade and economic growth.

(See box 4.2.)"
2003,"Ongoing Bank-supported operations that promote gender equality include an HIV/AIDS project in Zambia, a community-based empowerment project in southern India, and a tourism and regional development project in Honduras. Innovative initiatives in gender-based development, such as a rural roads project in Peru, a women’s empowerment and rural electrification project in Bangladesh, and a water and sanitation project in Ghana, continue to receive funding and technical assistance from the Bank. A new research initiative on gender and economic policy is developing a substantial body of analytical work to enhance policies in areas such as trade and competitiveness and public sector streamlining. The Bank also promoted research on measuring women’s empowerment, partnering with international development agencies on research that empirically demonstrates the importance of gender equality to all of the MDGs. Investment climate assessments prepared by the Bank this year have incorporated questions to capture gender-based differences."
2003,"In fiscal 2003 lending volumes were $1.9 billion for rural development. The Bank’s new rural strategy will promote broad-based rural growth that enhances agricultural productivity by focusing on poor people, addressing the entire rural area, building alliances with stakeholders, and identifying the impacts of global developments such as trade protectionism and climate change. (See box 4.6, box 4.7, and www.worldbank.org/ruralstrategy.)"
2003,"Transportation has an essential intermediate contribution to make to each of the MDGs, and lending to the transportation sector increased to $2.7 billion in fiscal 2003. (See also under “Transportation and Trade” in the “Poverty Reduction and Economic Management” section of this chapter.)"
2003,"During fiscal 2003 the Bank has been focusing greater attention on the legal aspects of its work in investment climate and finance, environmental sustainability, the promotion of gender equality (see box 4.10), infrastructure (see page 74), and trade (see page 61)."
2003,"In response to a need for standards in the area of insolvency and creditor rights, the Bank, in collaboration with the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American Development Bank, IFC, IMF, OECD, the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, INSOL International, and the International Bar Association, has developed the World Bank Principles and Guidelines for Effective Insolvency and Creditor Rights Systems. The Principles form the basis for Bank-led assessments of insolvency and creditor rights systems under a joint program with the IMF to develop Reports on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSCs). To date, 14 insolvency ROSCs have been completed and another 7 are in progress. These ROSCs support diagnostic and strategic work, underpin policy dialogue and lending operations, and provide input for technical assistance and capacity-building efforts (e.g., in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Turkey). Notably, the Principles have been used by countries to assess ongoing law reform efforts even where no ROSC has been undertaken (e.g., in Kosovo, Poland, and Serbia). In the Slovak Republic, insolvency reform has been a core component of"
2003,"Africa has continued to register progress in many areas. Sixteen countries averaged greater than 4 percent growth over the last decade. Investment and trade trends have been steady. Net foreign direct investment (FDI) to Africa rose to $6.8 billion in 2001 but was heavily concentrated in oil-exporting countries and South Africa. Africa had the highest returns on FDI of any region in the world, and the flow of workers’ remittances back to the continent doubled in only two years, reaching $4 billion in calendar year 2002. Access to new information technologies is expanding by about 10 percent annually, with Internet use rising sharply. Air transportation has been a high-growth sector, with 31.8 million passengers recorded—a 9 percent annual increase during years preceding the terrorist attacks of September 11,2001. Illiteracy has continued to decline, from 50 percent in 1990 to 37 percent in"
2003,"The World Bank, the largest provider of development assistance to Africa, seeks to accelerate progress toward attaining the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in Africa. The Bank’s strategic objective is consistent with objectives outlined by African heads of state in the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) Initiative and is based on the analysis of the study titled Can Africa Claim the 21st Century? Indeed, at the request of NEPAD the World Bank agreed to support the pan-African initiative in a number of specific areas: infrastructure, agriculture, regional trade facilitation, health, nutrition, population, education, community-driven development, and capital flows."
2003,"The Bank is focusing on better management of revenues from natural resources (which help finance African conflicts). It has launched an initiative that aims to promote international policy measures to improve transparency of revenues from commodity exports (oil and gas) and reduce rents from illegal trade of commodities linked to conflict (diamonds, precious metals, and timber)."
2003,"Regional integration is critical to creating larger markets to achieve economies of scale, foster competition, and attract foreign investment. The Bank has formulated regional integration assistance strategies for West and Central Africa and is planning such strategies for eastern and southern Africa. These strategies support harmonization of macroeconomic policies, liberalization of intraregional trade, and promotion of regional investment, as well as development of regional projects in infrastructure and the strengthening of regional institutions’ capacity.

2003,"Although the region has benefited tremendously from trade integration—specifically export-driven growth—the East Asian financial crisis brought a sense of vulnerability, particularly for the lower income countries, many of which have yet to see the benefits of integration."
2003,"With this in mind the Bank is studying the impacts of trade and ways to improve integration in the region to help countries better position themselves and benefit from trade. Key parts of the study focus on the effects of regional and global integration on the poorer countries and households and on declining sectors. The study addresses behind-the-border issues, including technical barriers and product standards, logistics, services sectors, intellectual property rights, and environmental and labor standards."
2003,"The Bank has supplemented the research through consultations with key audiences, workshops in Asian capitals, and development of GDLN Trade Dialogues in partnership with the World Bank Institute."

It has also provided analytical and advisory support to these countries as well as to Costa Rica and Honduras, as they negotiate a free trade agreement with the United States."
2003,"Creating a business-friendly environment remains an important priority for the Bank in the Middle East and North Africa, where geopolitics pose an added challenge to attracting investors. Investment climate assessments conducted in Algeria and Morocco revealed the obstacles faced by investors. Among the key constraints identified are administrative bottlenecks, limited access to credit and industrial land, and human resource constraints, all of which ultimately undermine the competitiveness of the countries’ private sector. The Bank has initiated similar assessments for Iran, Oman, and Syria.

2003,Failed Trades: Failed trades are securities transactions that do not settle on the contractual settlement date.
2003,Futures and Forwards: Futures and forward contracts are contracts for delivery of securities or money market instruments in which the seller agrees to make delivery at a specified future date of a specified instrument at a specified price or yield. Futures contracts are traded on U.S. and international regulated exchanges.
2003,"Investments: Investment securities are classified based on management’s intention on the date of purchase, their nature, and IBRD’s policies governing the level and use of such investments. At June 30, 2003 and June 30, 2002, all investment securities were held in a trading portfolio. Investment securities and related financial instruments held in IBRD’s Trading portfolio are carried and reported at fair value, using trade-date accounting. The first-in first-out (FIFO) method is used to determine the cost of securities sold in computing the realized gains and losses on these instruments. Unrealized gains and losses for investment securities and related financial instruments held in the Trading portfolio are included in income. Derivative instruments are used in liquidity management to take advantage of profitable trading opportunities and as a proxy for cash securities. These derivatives are carried at fair value. From time to time, IBRD enters into forward contracts for the sale or purchase of investment securities; these transactions are recorded at the time of commitment."
2003,"For options, IBRD only invests in exchange-traded options. The initial price of an option contract is equal to the premium paid by the purchaser and is significantly less than the contract or notional amount. IBRD does not write uncovered option contracts as part of its investment portfolio strategy."
2003,"Line of credit: IBRD maintains a line of credit with an independent financial institution. This facility was created for the benefit of both IBRD and IDA. The available line of credit to each institution is $500 million, but usage from both institutions cannot exceed $500 million in aggregate. The line of credit is used to cover any overnight overdrafts that may occur due to failed trades. At June 30, 2003, IBRD had drawn down $1 million under this facility. At June 30,"

2003,"Futures: Futures are contracts for delivery of securities or money market instruments in which the seller agrees to make delivery at a specified future date of a specified instrument, at a specified price or yield. Futures contracts are traded on regulated United States and international exchanges. IDA generally closes out most open positions in futures contracts prior to maturity. Therefore, cash receipts or payments are mostly limited to the change in market value of the futures contracts. Futures contracts generally entail daily settlement of the variation margin."
2003,"Options: Options are contracts that allow the holder of the option the right, but not the obligation, to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a specified price within a specified period of time from or to the seller of the option. The purchaser of an option pays a premium at the outset to the seller of the option, who then bears the risk of an unfavorable change in the price of the financial instrument underlying the option. IDA invests only in exchange-traded options. The initial price of an option contract is equal to the premium paid by the purchaser and is significantly less than the contract or notional amount."

2003,"Under simplified procedures for structural and sectoral adjustment loans approved by the executive directors in fiscal 1996, disbursements are no longer directly linked to procurement under adjustment loans disbursed using simplified procedures. Thus, while appendixes 3B to 6 report on disbursements from the IBRD and IDA, they do not include disbursements under adjustment loans disbursed using simplified procedures. The information in Appendix 7 reflects simplified adjustment loan disbursements to each borrower as pro-rata shares of that borrower’s eligible imports from supplying countries using import data drawn from United Nations trade statistics."

2003,"a source of growth and poverty reduction. We recognized that it is essential for developed countries to do more to open their markets and eliminate trade-distorting subsidies for products that represent major potential exports for developing countries, such as agriculture, textiles and clothing. At the same time, we recognized the importance of continued efforts towards trade liberalization in developing countries as part of an overall development strategy, in conjunction with the necessary policies and capacities that facilitate an appropriate supply response and minimize the adjustment burdens on the poor. We"
2003,"therefore welcomed the increased attention to trade issues in the work of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in support of a successful Doha Development Agenda. We urged intensified efforts to mainstream trade in the development dialogue with the Bank's members, with an enhanced operational focus on building both institutional and physical capacity to help developing countries take advantage of new trade opportunities."
2003,"8.	Trade remains of crucial importance to growth and poverty reduction. At a time of global uncertainty, it"
2003,"is even more important to demonstrate that multilateral cooperation can succeed in meeting the ambitious targets set for the Doha Development Agenda. We urge countries to come to an agreement quickly in those areas where Doha deadlines have already been missed. It is essential for developed countries to do more to liberalize their markets and eliminate trade-distorting subsidies, including in the areas of agriculture, textiles and clothing, which are of particular importance for developing countries. At the same time, we emphasize the importance of trade facilitation and liberalization efforts in developing countries. These efforts must be integrated into an overall development strategy, in conjunction with the necessary policies, infrastructure and institutional capacities that strengthen their ability to participate in international trade. We call on the Bank and the Fund to continue to step up their efforts to support trade. We urge that future Country Assistance Strategies include trade-enhancing lending operations and capacity building for member countries where such trade-related support is a clear country priority."
2003,"At June 30, 2003, $103,604 million (58.2%) of the uncalled capital was callable from the member countries of IBRD that are also members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). This amount slightly exceeded IBRD’s outstanding borrowings including swaps at June 30, 2003. Table 11 sets out the capital"
2003,"Development Credits: IDA’s development credits have a significant grant element because of the concessional nature of IDA's terms. Discounting the future cash flows from IDA's development credits using government reference rates represented by interest rates of government securities having similar maturity to the portfolio of development credits, provides an estimate for the grant element. Under the HIPC Debt Initiative, development credits identified for sale to the HIPC Debt Initiative Trust Fund are written down to their estimated net present value using currency specific Commercial Interest Reference Rates (CIRRs) published monthly by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Using the six months average CIRR as a discount rate provides an alternative estimate for the grant element."

The gaps between girls’ and boys’ enrollments have narrowed. But other data are sobering: estimates show that more than 113 million children remain out of school, 150 million children remain underweight, and maternal deaths average 440 per 100,000 in developing countries (compared with 21 in high-income countries) HIV/AIDS continues to present a formidable obstacle to reaching the goals, although a few countries are beginning to reap successes from prevention programs.

Steady recovery in other parts of East Asia has renewed progress in poverty reduction, which was interrupted during the crisis. 2000 marks the second consecutive year of growth for East Asia’s major economies. Countries are financially stronger than they were four years ago, which will help them manage the impact of the global contraction this year Revitalizing the business sector is essential to enhance resistance to shocks. Some smaller economies are lagging, and disparities within larger economies are high. Social vulnerability remains worrisome nearly half the population lives on less than $2 a day. Progress on other social development goals—which require effective institutions and service delivery—has been slower The need for increased responsiveness of public institutions has thus grown, in step with the emergence of an active civil society, a growing policy debate, and changes in government. Finally, the environment needs renewed attention"

2001,"To promote regional competitiveness, the Bank is investing in information infrastructure, technology innovation, and skills development. Thailand’s CDPC is addressing key constraints in these areas, complemented by technical assistance from partners. The Bank-managed Vietnam Development Information Center is a multidonor-funded cutting-edge facility that offers distance learning and public access to global knowledge; the operation is one of four Global Development Learning Network centers established by the Bank in Asia. Through knowledge and country development partnerships established with countries such as the Republic of Korea and Thailand, the Bank is facilitating access to global development knowledge to reduce vulnerability and strengthen competitiveness (box 4.4). Work has also advanced with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to assess China’s knowledge economy and requirements for technological innovation.

Closely involving client governments, civil society, the private sector, and multilateral and bilateral partners at all stages and levels of country assistance—policy dialogue, formulation of Bank CASs, and design and implementation of lending and nonlending services—has become the norm. Collaboration with major institutional partners, such as the IMF and the United Nations (U N.), has intensified. Operational cooperation and coordination with multilateral development banks (MDBs) has advanced significantly, and several technical working groups are launching efforts to promote coherence m approaches and harmonization of policies and procedures (on matters ranging from environmental assessments and financial management to corruption and gender). For global public goods, strategic partnerships with national governments, civil society, international organizations, bilateral donors, and the corporate sector have become fundamental to the Bank’s engagement. In many arenas, joint work with U N agencies, the IMF, and MDBs is crucial Important examples are the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization focusing on prevention of communicable diseases, the Financial Stability Forum helping to prevent and manage financial crises, the Prototype Carbon Fund that addresses climate change issues, the Global Development Gateway aimed at increasing access worldwide to development knowledge, and work with the World Trade Organization and other partners on integrating least developed countries into the multilateral trade system."

2001,"Financing for productive activities in Africa is severely con strained by a perception that the region is highly risky. In many countries, however, this perception is not justified by circumstances. The IDA-supported Regional Trade Facilitation Project (RTFP, S110 million) tackles this problem by bringing together countries that are willing to address the market’s perception by setting up a credible insurance mechanism against losses caused by political risks. These ceurtries' governments would be the ultimate risk takers in the Insurance mechanism, creating a strong disincentive to cause claims. Private insuiers, while not currently able to assume the high political risk in cross-border transactions involving African countries, would-with the public sector’s assumption of rlsk-be able to extend activities in the region."

Global Public Goods: The Committee welcomed the Bank’s progress in supporting global public goods in the areas endorsed by the Committee at its last meeting—i.e., communicable disease, trade integration, financial stability, knowledge and environmental commons. The Committee welcomed the Bank’s commitment to anchor its global public goods activities in its core business and country work, to remain selective and focused in each of these areas, to consolidate its cooperation and division of labor with other international partners, and to carry out further analytical work with its development partners on the financing arrangements and governance required for support of global public goods, including cautiously exploring a possible role for IDA grants."

The Committee broadly endorsed the global, regional and national level work program set forth in the Bank’s paper prepared for this meeting, including, most importantly, expanded activities at the country level which would increasingly be highlighted in the Bank Country Assistance Strategies This would include support for countries to address trade issues in their PRSPs. The Committee agreed on the particular significance of focusing on ""behind the border"" issues—such as investment regulations, obstacles to efficient transport of goods and materials, standards and technical regulations, telecommunications, and business services—to ensure that countries are able to take full advantage of the opportunities presented by globalization In response to the need to increase the capacity of the poorest nations to participate more effectively in the international trading system, the Committee urged the Bank to work together with its partners to achieve maximum benefits from the recently strengthened Integrated Framework for Trade Related Assistance for the Least Developed Countries. In this context the Committee welcomed efforts to untie aid, including the recent ad referendum decision by OECD donors to untie their aid to the Least Developed Countries"

2000,"Also noteworthy was the support for rural development and environmental needs ($1.5 billion, half of which for China), while multisector lending (so.5 billion) reflected mainly assistance for disaster recovery, including prevention and risk mitigation efforts."
2000,"Worldwide, the number and proportion of people living in extreme poverty declined slightly through the mid-1990s. Most of the decline was in East Asia, notably in China. But progress slowed temporarily in some Asian countries in the late 1990s, and ground to a halt or reversed in others. In the rest of the world, while the proportion of people in poverty declined, population growth meant that the number of poor people increased. And in the Europe and Central Asia region, undergoing economic and social transition, the proportion of poor more than tripled."
2000,"and if inequality does not increase. Progress has been uneven: While the poverty rate has fallen in some large countries, especially in China, other parts of the world have seen an increase in the proportion of people living in extreme poverty. Social indicators have generally improved over three decades but progress in many areas has been too slow to allow achievement of the international goals. And inequalities across income level and gender are often evident. In India, for example, the majority of 15- to 19-year-olds from the bottom 40 percent of households has not completed even one year of schooling, whereas the same age group from the richest 20 percent of households has completed 10 years of school. Similar patterns exist in many7 developing countries."

Examples include the introduction of an early warning network under the Amazon Emergency Fire Prevention and Control Project and efforts to prevent the spread of disease and to rebuild roads after floods in three Chinese provinces under the Yangtze Emergency Rehabilitation Project."
2000,"Economic and financial conditions recovered sharply in 1999 from the trials of the prior two years. At an estimated 3.3 percent, world economic growth exceeded expectations, led by a strong United States economy and policy reforms in emerging market countries. Global trade recovered strongly, and commodity prices firmed. These elements will permit more “self-financing” of development by countries. The present challenge is to sustain and strengthen this economic turnaround. Global Development Finance zooo suggests that those countries that rely more heavily on trade, are more diversified, attract more foreign direct investment, and have become more competitive are the most likely to sustain growth."
2000,"The goals for international development aim at a world free of poverty. Set in quantitative terms, the goals come from the agreements and resolutions of the world conferences organized by the United Nations in the 1990s and reconfirmed at the Social Summit in Geneva in June 2000. The goals will not be easy to achieve, but progress in some countries and regions shows what can be done. The message is that if some countries can make great strides in reducing poverty in its many forms, others can as well. But it will take hard work. Success will require, above all, stronger voices for poor people, economic stability and growth that favors them, basic social services for all, open markets for trade and technology, and good use of the resources for development."

Economic Policy comprises operations that support macroeconomic policy, trade, and other economic and institutional reforms. It includes structural adjustment operations previously assigned to Multisector and some operations previously assigned to Finance. Private Sector Development comprises operations dealing with the business environment, private infrastructure, small scale enterprise, and privatization issues. As such, it includes some operations previously assigned to Industry and to Public Sector Management.

2000,"Most countries have been pursuing reforms that will equip them for global economic integration: restoring macroeconomic balance, improving resource allocation, and creating conditions more promising for efficient investment. Since 1995, the median African economy has grown at about 4 percent per year, the best sustained performance since independence. Markets have been opened, currencies realigned, tariffs reduced, and price controls abolished. The export sector has been revitalized and is currently growing at around 8 percent. Ongoing efforts at regional integration are providing a boost to intra-African trade and to export expansion. Subregional institutions such as the Southern Africa Development Community (sadc) and the Economic and Monetary Union of West Africa (uemoa), along with bilateral cooperation initiatives such as the Maputo Corridor, are facilitating cross-border trade and investment initiatives. New financial institutions and regional stock exchanges have also been taking root."

The challenge for Africa and the Bank will be to consolidate and deepen policy gains to achieve higher growth and better governance. Dealing with the hiv/aids crisis, putting special emphasis on human development, and delivering resources directly to poor people will be among the top priorities for the region. An important challenge for Africa will also be to find the capacity to develop, introduce, and sustain reforms. In fiscal 2000, the Bank continued to support the Partnership for Capacity Building in Africa (pact), a collaborative framework between African countries, the Bank, and other donors, which was approved"
2000,"Eeast Asia’s recovery from the 1997—98 financial crisis strengthened during fiscal 2000 and is gaining momentum, though unevenly across countries (see Figure 4.2). External developments supported this recovery, as demand for the region’s exports increased and the region’s terms of trade improved. While the social impact of the crisis was less than had originally been feared, poverty became more acute throughout the region, affecting school attendance and preventive health care expenditures. Nonetheless, the creation of new jobs has offered hope to workers and their families, and while incomes of low-income groups have not yet been restored, renewed economic growth has at least halted the decline of incomes. With a few more years of growth, poverty levels would return to those prevailing before the crisis."
2000,"The challenges facing the Pacific Island countries (Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Marshall Islands, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu) are: to overcome the constraints they share as small states, including economic and environmental vulnerability; to deal with changing global trade regimes; to improve institutional and human capacity; and to identify practical options in response to the ongoing process of globalization. A major challenge unique to these countries is how to provide sustainable and meaningful economic and social opportunities and services for growing populations within a context of fast-paced social, cultural, and economic change."

However, with capital flight at peak rates of about 10 percent of gdp in 1999, sustained recovery will require the new government to give high priority to strengthening the climate for private sector development. Recovery in Ukraine will likewise depend on the policies of the new administration. Sustaining momentum in policy reform will also be key to continued growth in Central Asia and the Caucasus; while better terms of trade and an expanding Russian economy helped economic performance in 1999, progress in reform was erratic due to elections in many countries."
2000,"In an early effort to carry out the Pact’s mandate, the Bank collaborated closely with partners to prepare a regional strategy paper. The Road to Stability and Prosperity in South East Europe proposes four areas of action: to move rapidly toward trade integration with the W and create a stable, transparent, and nondiscriminatory environment for private sector development; to foster social inclusion and efforts to promote peace; to improve institutional capacity and governance, with a focus on corruption; and to invest in infrastructure, with attention to environmental concerns."
2000,"1998.	The contributing factors were external shocks to terms of trade and reduced access to capital markets; natural disasters—an earthquake in Colombia and devastating floods in the Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela—compounded problems for those countries. The regional current account deficit declined, due mainly to reduced imports. While fiscal balances deteriorated, they are expected to improve. Also promising was foreign direct investment (fdi), which surged to a record $89 billion in 1999 and bodes well for the future, especially in Brazil and Mexico. Overall, prospects have brightened, due to the receding impact of shocks to terms of trade and renewed access to international capital markets."
2000,"stopped speculative capital outflows and enabled rapid economic recovery. Mexico’s tight fiscal policy and a flexible foreign exchange regime (helped by a booming U.S. economy) reassured external creditors and spurred growth of about 3.5 percent. Peru’s growth also approached 4 percent, as exchange rate movements helped the economy adjust to shocks and recover from El Nino problems. Other large countries fared poorly, however. Argentina was affected by declining commodity prices, by trade shocks triggered by Brazil’s currency crisis, and by reduced access to (more costly) private financing. In Colombia, Ecuador, and the Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela, internal political difficulties and financial system weaknesses intensified the slump, prompting authorities to raise interest rates to avoid currency runs in the face of external shocks."
2000,"Case studies in Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador; Mexico, and Peru confirm that economic conditions are significant determinants of who becomes a crime victim in the region. High-income employed, educated men are more likely to become the victims of crime, for example; but police presence, youth gangs, illicit drug trade, and availability of weapons are also important risk factors. Lack of reliable data impedes effective allocation of public resources to reduce crime in most LAC countries. The studies’data and conclusions will help address this need and assist policymakers in crime reduction."
2000,"During the 1990s, tighter demand management, trade liberalization, and improved regulatory reform measures helped improve economic performance in most economies of the Middle East and North Africa (mna) region. Average annual GNP growth during the 1990s was slightly more than 3 percent, compared with 2.1 percent growth in the 1980s."
2000,"In the second half of 1999, the regions fiscal and current account balances improved, owing mainly to higher oil prices. Regional gdp growth was 2.2 percent for the year, with considerable differences across countries. For major oil exporters, the swift reversal in terms of trade was equivalent to an increase of over 5 percent of gdp, but fiscal prudence and lower oil export volume held growth to 1.5 percent. More populated oil exporters (Algeria, the Islamic Republic of Iran) fared slightly better with 2.7 percent growth, although drought in Iran hurt agricultural incomes and raised inflationary pressures. The more diversified economies (Jordan, Morocco, the Syrian Republic) also suffered from drought but managed growth of nearly 3 percent. Growth was significantly higher in the Arab Republic of Egypt and Tunisia (5—6 percent) following the recovery of traditional markets and a rise in tourism."
2000,"Poor people highlight powerlessness, pointing to officials, traders and civic actors who are neither responsive nor accountable to them. They share numerous examples of criminality, abuse and corruption in encounters with public institutions, saying they have little recourse to justice. “Government has let us down, too many promises—never fulfilling them,” says a 30-year-old unemployed mother from the Caribbean. In poor communities worldwide, local groups and actors are key supports; however, poor people recognize limits to how much “one hungry man can help another hungry man.”"
2000,"Partnerships are integral to the Bank 's work in poverty reduction and economic management. They are central to participatory, country-driven poverty reduction strategies and they also bolster the Bank’s work on gender, public sector reform, trade, and international financial architecture. Collaboration with the Fund increased over the past year: on international standards (for accounting, corporate governance, and insolvency regimes); trade; and the Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC') and the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers program through the establishment of the Joint Implementation Committee, whose agenda included the streamlining of procedures for approval of debt relief and other concessional assistance."

2000,"Trade reform plays a critical role in spurring growth and, thus, in reducing poverty. The Bank supports developing country trade in several ways. First, analytical work is increasing understanding of the link between trade, development, and poverty reduction; the potential advantages of regional trade agreements; and the importance of coordination among multilateral organizations on trade-related issues. Second, research and assistance are helping developing countries to formulate negotiating objectives for trade and to adapt to the changing nature of trade in services, product standards, and absorption of technology. Finally, operational support to developing countries continues to help them maximize the benefits to their economies from international trade."
2000,"The Bank relies largely on adjustment but also on investment operations to further countries’ trade agendas. While many developing countries have taken major steps to liberalize their trade regimes, a significant number have, so far, failed to reap the advantages of greater integration into the global economy. A major reason, particularly for the poorest countries, relates to an inadequate supply of the human and physical capital needed for trade. Excessive trade protection on the part of both developed and middle-income countries also remains a serious problem. Between 1990 and 1998, 68 percent of Bank"
2000,"adjustment operations included support for reform of trade and exchange rate policies. In comparison, the Bank’s investment lending for trade-related activities accounted for around 26 percent of total Bank lending from 1994 to 1999."
2000,Futures and Forwards: Futures and forward contracts are contracts for delivery of securities or money market instruments in which the seller agrees to make delivery at a specified future date of a specified instrument at a specified price or yield. Futures contracts are traded on U.S. and international regulated exchanges.
2000,"Investments: Investment securities are classified based on management’s intention on the date of purchase. Securities which management has the intention and ability to hold until maturity are classified as Held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost. Securities designated for other postretirement benefits are carried and reported at market value or at their estimated fair values. The changes in the values of the securities designated for other postretirement benefits are included in the determination of net income. All other investment securities are held in a Trading portfolio and classified as an element of liquidity in the Statement of Cash Flows due to their nature and IBRD’s policies governing the level and use of such investments. Investment securities and related financial instruments held in IBRD’s Trading portfolio are carried and reported at market value. Unrealized gains and losses for investment securities and related financial instruments held in the Trading portfolio are included in income. Derivative instruments are used in liquidity management to take advantage of profitable trading opportunities and as a proxy for cash securities. These instruments include short-term, over-the-counter foreign exchange forwards, currency swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps, and exchange-traded futures and options on fixed income instruments. These derivatives are carried at market value. From time to time, IBRD enters into forward contracts for the sale or purchase of investment securities; these transactions are recorded at the time of commitment."
2000,"IBRD uses derivatives in its borrowing and liability management activities to create synthetic debt instruments to take advantage of cost saving opportunities across capital markets and lower its funding costs, to delink the time at which its borrowing costs are fixed from the timing of the actual market borrowings, and to establish an appropriate match between the currency and interest rate characteristics of its assets and liabilities. These instruments include currency and interest rate swaps, swap spread-locks, foreign exchange forwards, exchange-traded futures and options. These derivatives are used to modify the interest rate and/or currency characteristics of the borrowing portfolio and are linked to the related borrowings at inception and remain so throughout the terms of their contracts. The interest component of these derivatives is recognized as an adjustment to the borrowing cost over the life of the derivative contract and included in Interest under Borrowing Expenses on the income statement. Upon termination, the change in the derivative’s market value is recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of the underlying borrowing and recognized as an adjustment of the borrowing cost over the remaining life of the borrowing. In instances where the underlying borrowing is prepaid, the change in the associated derivative’s market value is recognized immediately as an adjustment to the cost of the underlying borrowing instrument and accordingly in the determination of net income. Currency swap payables and receivables are recorded on a historical cost basis and are separate items on the balance sheet. The notional principal on interest rate swaps is treated as an off-balance sheet item."
2000,"For options, IBRD only invests in exchange-traded options. The initial price of an option contract is equal to the premium paid by the purchaser and is significantly less than the contract or notional amount. IBRD does not write uncovered option contracts as part of its investment portfolio strategy."
2000,"Forwards and Futures: Futures and forward contracts are contracts for delivery of securities or money market instruments in which the seller agrees to make delivery at a specified future date of a specified instrument, at a specified price or yield. Futures contracts are traded on regulated United States and international exchanges. IDA generally closes out most open positions in futures contracts prior to maturity. Therefore, cash receipts or payments are mostly limited to the change in market value of the futures contracts. Futures contracts gene rally entail daily settlement of the net cash margin."
2000,"Options: Options are contracts that allow the holder of the option the right, but not the obligation, to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a specified price within a specified period of time from or to the seller of the option. The purchaser of an option pays a premium at the outset to the seller of the option, who then bea's the risk of an unfavorable change in the price of the financial instrument underlying the option.

IDA does not write uncovered option contracts."
2000,"Under simplified procedures for structural and sectoral adjustment loans approved by the executive directors in fiscal 1996, disbursements are no longer directly linked to procurement under adjustment loans disbursed using simplified procedures. Thus, while appendixes 7b to 10 report on disbursements from the ibrd and IDA, they do not include disbursements under adjustment loans disbursed using simplified procedures. The information in Appendix 11 reflects simplified adjustment loan disbursements to each borrower as pro-rata shares of that borrower’s eligible imports from supplying countries using import data drawn from United Nations trade statistics."
2000,"12.	Developing and Transition Countries and the International Trade Agenda. The Committee noted that effective development and trade policy have become increasingly intertwined. They emphasized the importance of trade to development, poverty alleviation, and sustained global economic recovery. Ministers also emphasized that the next round of trade negotiations needed to deliver early and substantial benefits for developing and transition countries, in particular for the least developed countries. This would require improved market access and further reduce barriers to trade. They stressed that if developing and transition countries are to use the international trading system effectively to promote growth and reduce poverty, they will need to become active partners in the next round of trade negotiations. Ministers welcomed the commitment of the new Director-General of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Mr. Mike Moore, to achieve this goal and urged the World Bank, the Fund, WTO, UNCTAD, and other agencies to help developing and transition countries build their capacity to participate in further rounds of negotiations. The Committee called on the Bank, the Fund, and WTO to cooperate with other parties in developing effective programs of capacity building for trade, including through the Integrated Framework for"

2000,"1.	The 61st meeting of the Development Committee was held in Washington, D.C., on April 17, 2000 under the chairmanship of Mr. Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, Minister of Finance of Thailand. The Committee’s deliberations took place against the background of growing public debate about the appropriate roles of international institutions at a time when governments and people throughout the world confront the opportunities and rapid changes brought about by globalization. In their discussions of how to strengthen efforts to reduce poverty, to intensify the attack on HIV/ AIDS, and to expand the benefits of trade to all countries, Ministers emphasized the importance they attach to preserving and further strengthening the family of multilateral institutions as a powerful force for global progress, equity, and stability."
2000,"5.	Trade, Development and Poverty Reduction. Ministers emphasized the critical importance of trade for development and poverty reduction. They noted that accelerated and sustainable growth is a necessary condition for reducing poverty, and that more open economies tend to grow faster than closed ones; evidence suggests that substantial benefits could be gained from further liberalization of trade regimes in both developed and developing (including transition] countries. Ministers recognized that developed countries have much to do to improve market access for developing countries’ exports (e.g. agriculture, textiles). Developing countries need to implement appropriately sequenced outward-oriented reforms that will permit trade expansion to promote development and poverty reduction. Ministers noted that the majority of the poorest countries lag behind in their integration into the world trading system. Additional domestic and international reforms are needed, including special consideration of enhanced market access for these countries (e.g., by extending comprehensive and predictable duty-and quota-free market access). Ministers also noted the potential of regional integration to help developing countries increase their share in global markets. Ministers strongly endorsed a timely initiation of WTO multilateral trade negotiations that address, inter alia, issues of most concern to developing countries."
2000,"6.	Ministers emphasized that countries should ensure that their efforts to expand trade are integrated into a comprehensive framework for development that includes the necessary complementary reforms and investment in institutions, infrastructure, and social programs. Ministers endorsed the commitment of the World Bank and the Fund to use their programs to support these efforts, which are increasingly reflected in countries’ poverty reduction strategies. Ministers reiterated their call on the Bank, the Fund, and WTO to cooperate with other parties in developing effective programs of capacity building for trade, including through an improved Integrated Framework for Trade Related Assistance for the Least Developed Countries.

Ministers welcomed the report to the Development Committee and its analysis of the special characteristics of small states that make them particularly vulnerable, while noting that a number of larger states shared some or all of the same characteristics. They noted the report’s conclusions that tackling small states’ development challenges will take a combination of correct domestic policy action, continued external assistance, and where achievable, improvements in the external environment. They also noted the report’s recommendation that the circumstances of small states should be taken into account in the policies and programs of the multilateral trade, finance, and development organizations. The Committee supported World Bank and the Fund proposals for their future work programs on the issues of small states, as"

2000,"At June 30, 2000, $103,115 million (58%) of the uncalled capital was callable from the member countries of IBRD that are also members of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. This amount was equal to 90.4% of IBRD's outstanding borrowings after swaps at June 30, 2000. Table 5 sets out the capital subscriptions of those countries and the callable amounts."
2000,"Development Credits: IDA's development credits have a significant grant element because of the concessional nature of IDA’s terms. Discounting the future cash flows from IDA’s development credits using government reference rates represented by interest rates ol government securities having similar duration to the portfolio of development credits, provides an estimate for the grant element. Under the Initial HIPC Debt Initiative, development credits identified for sale to the HIPC Debt Initiative Trust Fund are written down to their estimated net present value using currency specific Commercial Interest Reference Rates (CIRRs) published monthly by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Using the six months average CIRR as a discount rate provides an alternative estimate for the grant element."

Discounting the future cash flows from Interim Fund credits using government reference rates represented by interest rates of government securities having similar duration to the portfolio of Interim Fund credits, provides an estimate for the grant element. Currency specific Commercial Interest Reference Rates (CIRRs) are published monthly by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Using the average of six months as a discount rate provides an alternative estimate for the grant element. CIRR currency specific rates for the SDR have been used to discount the future cash flows from the Interim Fund Credits. The prior year’s fair value of Interim Fund credits has been restated using government reference rates to conform to the current year’s presentation."
2010,"Despite increases in the world's population, the number of people living in extreme poverty in the world is falling, thanks to rapid progress in China and India. These advances are probably not enough to halve the number of people in the world living on less than $1.25 day or the proportion of people who suffer from hunger by 2015 however, particularly given the continuing effects of the food crisis in Africa. Good progress has been made toward achieving universal primary education and gender equality in primary education, with the ratio of girls to boys rising in all regions to at least 90 percent."
2010,"In the run-up to the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, the Bank released several regional and sectoral flagship reports on climate change; helped to finalize low-carbon growth studies on Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Poland, and South Africa; and published the World Development Report (WDR) 2010: Development and Climate Change. The report urges the countries that produced most of the greenhouse gas emissions in the past to act now to shape the world's climate future by ramping up funding for adaptation and mitigation in developing countries, where most growth in emissions will occur. The WDR was complemented by ""The Economics of Adaptation to Climate Change,"" which estimates that it will cost $75 billion to $100 billion a year between"

2010,"As it emerges from crisis, the region can continue to grow strongly, despite the weaker global economy. But a renewed focus on reform is needed. The types of reforms needed range widely across countries. In China the challenge is to move the economy away from heavy manufacturing and export-led growth toward services and higher levels of private consumption. For other middle-income countries, such as Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam, the path to higher growth involves moving up the value chain through increased sophistication of production by investing more in physical and human capital and by fostering in-"
2010,"With the urban population of East Asia likely to increase by 50 percent in the next 20 years, energy demand is projected to more than double. The Bank's flagship report Winds of Change: East Asia's Sustainable Energy Future finds that with major annual investments in energy efficiency and a concerted switch to renewable sources of power, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam could stabilize their greenhouse gas emissions while increasing energy security and improving local environments."
2010,"Several new loans are helping countries in the region increase their energy efficiency. In China, where more than 70 percent of the Bank's program is related to the environment, a $100 million loan approved this fiscal year is financing a major energy efficiency drive that will replace inefficient industrial equipment, such as boilers and district heating systems, with energy-saving technologies. Projects targeting improved and more efficient urban transportation are helping major cities across China reduce pollution and carbon emissions. In Indonesia a new DPL worth $200 million is supporting efforts to develop a lower-carbon and more climate-resilient growth path. This climate change DPL is envisioned as the first of a series of four annual loans of similar size. The Bank is also supporting a program of public investment reforms in Vietnam through a series of DPLs aimed at strengthening the selection, preparation, implementation, and supervision of public investment projects. The first opera-"
2010,"The current pattern of global recovery has favored the region so far. Countercyclical policies have supported domestic demand in the larger countries, and external demand from fast-growing emerging markets, especially China's, has boosted exports and terms of trade for the region's net commodity exporters. Prospects in the short term appear"
2010,"Our shareholders also endorsed our internal reform agenda and post-crisis strategy. Through the strategy, we are sharpening our focus where we can add more value: targeting the poor and vulnerable, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa; creating opportunities for growth with a special emphasis on agriculture and infrastructure; promoting global collective action on issues from climate change and trade to agriculture, food security, energy, water, and health; strengthening governance and anticorruption efforts; and preparing for crises."

World trade volumes are projected to grow 11.2 percent in 2010 and 6.8 percent in 2011—a strong rebound after the staggering 11.6 percent drop in 2009—and economic growth in developing countries is projected to reach 6.2 percent in 2010 and 6.0 percent in 2011, up from just 1.7 percent in 2009. These positive trends notwithstanding, it will be years before jobs are restored and industrial capacity fully reabsorbed."
2010,"The World Bank has played a significant role during the global financial and economic crisis, pulling poor people out of poverty and keeping those who are not poor from becoming so. Bank initiatives have provided special vehicles for trade finance, microfinance, capitalization, and distressed debt; established a pilot IDA Crisis Response Window to mitigate the effects of the crisis; combined development and climate change policies to combat global warming; and integrated governance and security for fragile states emerging from conflict. The worst of the crisis seems to be over, but the world economy faces an uncertain and uneven recovery, with new risks to economic growth, human development, and poverty reduction. (See http://www.worldbank.org/worldbankreform)"
2010,"IDA support of regional integration and regional solutions increased substantially in fiscal 2010. Most projects are achieving encouraging results, as confirmed by a review of the AAP undertaken this year and by early feedback from broad-based, Africa-wide consultations to renew the AAP. Thanks in part to the implementation of an IDA project to rehabilitate the Northern Corridor transport system, which links Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda, transit times were reduced by 40 percent at some border crossings. Similar funding improved road, rail, and port infrastructure, resulting in more fluid trade and reductions in transit times in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, and Chad."
2010,"The median country in the region has fewer than 6 million people. Given the relatively small size of some of the countries and the high level of economic integration in the region, partnering is key for water and energy, transport, trade, corporate finance, and social inclusion. The Bank is working to develop a Southeastern Europe Energy Community that will establish a common regulatory framework for energy markets. It is helping craft regional transport solutions by assisting countries in their efforts to meet the transport requirements of the EU and ensuring that national and regional transport networks are developed in a coordinated, sustainable, and efficient manner. The Bank is also working with the European Commission on Roma exclusion issues, which affect numerous countries in the region, as well as providing support through the Roma Education Fund."

2004,"More than 1,000 people from the international community met in China in May 2004 for a unique forum on poverty reduction. The Shanghai Conference on Poverty Reduction, and the nine-month learning process that preceded it, provided an opportunity for participants to identify development successes and failures and to jointly explore ways to build on success."
2004,"Fueled by growing exports, low interest rates, and high investment in China, Thailand, and Vietnam, East Asia’s economy is expected to grow by more than 7 percent in 2004—the strongest growth since the beginning of the global slowdown in early 2000. This strong recovery bodes well for an estimated 49 million of the region’s poor, whose incomes are projected to rise above the $2-a-day poverty line."
2004,"China has been the driver of regional growth; its imports surged 40 percent in 2003. Intraregional trade still accounts for about 70 percent of the growth in exports of East Asia’s developing economies, as it has since 2002. But this trend will likely slow as current rapid growth rates in China level off."
2004,"Infrastructure played a central role in East Asia’s development, as evidenced in Japan; Hong Kong; Korea; Singapore; Taiwan, China; and more recently, mainland China and Vietnam. Sound economic policies and investments in power, transportation, water supply, telecommunications, education, and health services accounted for East Asia’s initial success in reducing poverty. In fiscal 2004 the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation launched a joint study to assess infrastructure needs in the region and examine ways to rebuild the climate for infrastructure investment, particularly by harnessing the private sector."
2004,"Empowering and giving voice to people are critical for development. In Indonesia the Justice for the Poor Initiative is working to help people understand their rights and strengthen village institutions that settle disputes. For its part, the Bank established Web sites in Chinese, Khmer, and Vietnamese and increased its offerings in Bahasa, Lao, Mongolian, Tetum, Thai, and other languages. In China the Bank is producing a Chinese-language newsletter, and in Cambodia the local press routinely draws stories from the Bank’s Khmer-language newsletter. Public Information Centers now operate in 11 of the region’s country offices.

(See www.worldbank.org/hnp.)"
2004,"Private sector research also influences advisory services and technical assistance. The network coordinates closely with many of the 10 IFC donor-supported funds, called Project Development Facilities. These facilities provide technical assistance to small firms and business organizations for work on improving difficult business environments. In Chengdu, China, to expand credit to small businesses, the Doing Business team provided the municipal government with information on global best-practice credit bureaus. With the support of the Doing Business team and the facility, FIAS is working with the People’s Bank of China on crafting recommendations for reforming the country’s collateral laws and improving creditor rights protections."
2004,"Since 1990 the Bank has played an important supportive role, through policy advice and institution building, in China’s enormous progress. In fiscal 2004 OED recommended that the Bank continue to play a role in China. However, with a reduced lending program and without IDA resources, both the Bank and China will need to adapt their policies and procedures to make the best use of Bank assistance."

As of June 30, 2004, China had not exceeded the single borrower exposure limit and therefore, activation of the arrangement was not required."
2004,"One highlight of the year was the development conference we cohosted with the Chinese government in Shanghai, the culmination of nine months of studying development experiences. Leaders from developing countries shared their successes and failures with other leaders. We learned that feeling good about individual projects is not enough.

2004,"The Board’s work during fiscal 2004 focused on the continued implementation of its Strategic Framework, last reviewed and updated in fiscal 2002. Management presented the Executive Directors with several papers on the strategic directions for the Bank Group for the fiscal 2004-06 period, including a medium-term strategy and finance paper. The Board reviewed these papers and expressed strong support for the continued focus on implementation and results toward attaining the MDGs, and on greater selectivity, trade-offs, redeployment, and efficiency gains."
2004,"■	On the eve of the Cancun trade talks in September 2003, the Bank launched Global Economic Prospects 2004: Realizing the Development Promise of the Doha Agenda. It presents a detailed overview of the world economy and an analysis of global trade issues, particularly those on the agenda for the Doha round of trade negotiations."
2004,"With broad agreement on the goals, the international community forged a shared development strategy at meetings in Doha, Monterrey, and Johannesburg, where trade, financing for development, and sustainable development were discussed. In Monterrey world leaders formed a consensus on mutual responsibilities: developing countries are called upon to improve policies and governance, and developed countries are called upon to step up support by providing more and better aid and more open access to their markets."
2004,"Entrepreneurship, investment, and innovation by the private sector drive economic growth, but they will not occur without the right environment. A good economic climate spurs domestic economic activity and attracts domestic and foreign investment. Such a climate can be identified by its positive characteristics: sound macroeconomic policies, openness to trade, good governance and institutions, strong financial markets that channel savings to productive uses and broaden access to finance, and the availability of key physical infrastructure (transportation, power, and telecommunications). Since 1999 many countries have improved their private business environments, according to evidence from Country Policy and Institutional Assessments conducted by the Bank using a number of indicators rated on a scale of one to six. (See figure 1.3.) Average ratings for business environment are rising but are still relatively low, showing continued weakness."

During the process of developing the strategy papers, countries identify their special circumstances and needs. The Bank plays an active role in helping clients strengthen the role of stakeholders in this process. (See “Reducing Poverty and Improving Economic Management” in chapter 3.) The Bank also encourages countries to integrate the Millennium Development Goals into their strategy papers, considering the cross-sectoral actions needed to achieve the goals. This approach will help ensure that country strategies address the trade-offs inherent in achieving the MDGs."
2004,"The Bank’s policy is to operate jointly with partners when addressing major development issues in both global and country program activities. It works closely with the IMF, other multilateral development banks, governments, the United Nations and its agencies, OECD’s Development Assistance Committee, bilateral donors, the World Trade Organization, and civil society organizations."
2004,"To sustain growth and eventually achieve economies of scale, African countries must reach regional and world markets. But growth is held back by the trade barriers and subsidies in the countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Africa’s greatest comparative advantage is in agriculture, but the $325 billion in annual subsidies to agriculture in OECD countries make it difficult for Africa to compete. These subsidies—equivalent to the combined GDP of all African countries—cost West African cotton producers about $250 million a year."
2004,"The Bank is promoting several initiatives that seek to sustain growth and diversify the African economy. It is supporting policy and institutional reforms to improve the investment climate and make Africa a good business destination. It has worked with regional institutions to formulate regional integration strategies that promote the liberalization of intraregional trade, the harmonization of macroeconomic policies, capacity building for regional institutions, the growth of capital markets, and the building of regional infrastructure, including transportation corridors. The demands are enormous: Africa’s infrastructure needs alone are estimated at about $18 billion a year."
2004,"China has been the driver of regional growth; its imports surged 40 percent in 2003.

In Indonesia the Bank is working on a trade and integration study."
2004,The signing of a free trade agreement by South Asian countries in January 2004 is providing new opportunities for economic integration. But the need to develop infrastructure within and between countries and to identify regulators and service providers is constraining the ability of the private sector to respond to the new trading environment.
2004,A $22 million credit is revitalizing telephone lines and the postal service. A $31 million credit will help increase revenue from trade by streamlining customs and transit regulations.
2004,"Improving roads and other travel infrastructure is a critical component of the Bank’s work in South Asia. These efforts have had a major impact on reducing poverty by cutting transportation costs and increasing poor people’s access to markets, education, and health care. To increase trade competitiveness in Pakistan, the Bank approved a $200 million loan and credit to revitalize the national highway system. In India a $240 million loan will help reduce transportation constraints by building a bypass to divert traffic from the historic city of Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh."
2004,"Individual Country Assistance Strategies also recognize the diversified needs of the subregions. In the poor countries of the CIS, the emphasis is on supporting sound economic management and private sector-led growth, promoting human development and equity, and improving governance. In the EU accession countries, the focus is increasingly on investments to enhance the benefits of accession and knowledge services. In South Eastern Europe and the larger countries of the CIS (Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine), the emphasis is on supporting growth with equity and improvements in governance—in the context of a wider EU agenda where relevant. Throughout the region, where issues go beyond the borders of a single country, as they do in the case of communicable diseases, water resources, trade and investment regimes, energy markets, and regulatory frameworks, the Bank is taking a multicountry approach."
2004,"The Bank’s analytical and advisory support to the region included studies of trade-related issues, research on innovation (development of intellectual capital) in selected countries, and a range of technical assistance efforts, such as urban management training for public officials in Colombia. The Bank proposed a new development strategy for Mexico’s southern states, published a report on Caribbean youth development, provided policy advice for Jamaica on achieving sustained growth, and developed a guide for Latin American mayors on how to implement urban crime and violence prevention programs."
2004,"Bank assistance is facilitating trade and enhancing productivity in Peru and Honduras, helping to increase"
2004,"In response to the region’s daunting labor market challenge, the Bank has placed employment creation at the core of its strategy. In fiscal 2004 it published four flagship reports—on governance, trade, gender, and employment in the region. The reports call for a transition from public sector-dominated to private sector-led economies, from closed to more open economies, and from volatile, oil-dominated economies to more stable and diversified economies. The transition requires better governance, including greater inclusiveness and accountability, a larger role for women in the public sphere, and improvements in the quality of education."
2004,"A World Bank Group Business Road Show in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates brought together people from the private sector to discuss how to boost their investments in the region and develop new business activities. The Bank also sponsored the Second Annual Knowledge for Development Conference. Held in Marseilles, the conference aimed at helping countries develop knowledge-based economies that will enhance their competitiveness and increase trade."
2004,"Growth is essential for poverty reduction, but sustained, successful poverty reduction also requires that poor people participate in and benefit from growth. In fiscal 2004 the Bank did much to foster such growth. (See www.worldbank.org/poverty/inequal.) Bank staff prepared framework papers on defining and measuring pro-poor growth and on the extent to which pro-poor and pro-growth policies involve trade-offs."
2004,"The Trust Fund for Gender Mainstreaming in the World Bank, financed by the governments of the Netherlands and Norway, is supporting capacity building among women in indigenous communities in Honduras, entrepreneurial opportunities for women in Tajikistan, and gender- and HIV/AIDS-related activities in Africa. An economic policy initiative is developing a body of analytical work on such areas as trade, competitiveness, and public sector downsizing."
2004,"The outcome of the Doha Development Round of Trade Negotiations matters a great deal to the world's poor An agreement that slashed trade barriers, particularly in agriculture, would, in the long term, stimulate trade and raise incomes around the world, leading to a substantial reduction in global poverty."
2004,TRADE
2004,"Research shows that trade boosts productivity, which in turn enhances growth. The Bank’s work on international trade promotes a world trading system that is more conducive to economic development and helps developing countries capture the benefits of global opportunities. (See box 3.1.) Established nearly two years ago, the Bank’s International Trade Group supports the successful conclusion of the Doha Development Round and strengthens partnerships with international organizations to enhance coherence and coordination in support of trade reforms."
2004,"During fiscal 2004 Bank researchers investigated the impact of trade liberalization on poverty, the ways in which multilateral and regional trade agreements can support the development process, the effect of international product standards on trade volumes and patterns, and the impact of liberalizing trade in infrastructure services such as telecommunications, port"
2004,BOX 3.1 TRADE: WORKING TOWARD RESULTS AT THE COUNTRY LEVEL
2004,"The Bank's regional trade work is being complemented with country work. The Integrated Framework (IF) Initiative to help the less-developed countries integrate into the world economy is an important part of this program. Trade diagnostic studies have been completed for Burundi, Cambodia, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Guinea, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali (near completion), Mauritania, Nepal, Senegal, and the Republic of Yemen. Integrated Framework dissemination workshops have been organized in these countries. Donor meetings have been held in Mauritania (November 2002), Senegal (June 2003), Nepal (November 2003), and Madagascar (January 2004). Several major studies on the impacts of Russia's accession to the World Trade Organization have also recently been completed."
2004,"The Bank's CIS-7 trade initiative, which covers the poorest countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States, focuses on trade, integration, and competitiveness, and provides technical assistance for export and investment facilitation.

Rising South-South investments, particularly investments originating in Asia, have played an important role in the rebound. The economies of Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, and the Russian Federation are poised to account for more than half of all global growth by 2025. They will help drive growth in lower-income countries through cross-border commercial and financial transactions, according to a new World Bank report, Global Development Horizons."

2011,"Africa's long-term growth will increasingly reflect interrelated social and demographic changes creating new domestic engines of growth. Key among these will be urbanization, an expanding labor force, and the rise of the middle-class African consumer. In 1980 just 28 percent of Africans lived in cities. Today 40 percent of the continent's 1 billion people do—a proportion roughly comparable to China's and larger than India's.

2011,"The region has the potential to secure its recovery and continue on its path of rapid and sustained growth—if it is able to harness opportunities and meet various challenges. Managing inflation was the key short-term challenge in the region this year, which was complicated by a surge in portfolio capital inflows and large increases in food and commodity prices. Looking forward, East Asia and Pacific countries need to increase regional integration to take advantage of a rapidly growing China. Reducing inequality and social exclusion, making cities in the region resilient to natural disasters, and addressing the effects of climate change are also important for continuous growth."

2011,"China became the world's second-largest economy in 2010, representing about 9.5 percent of global GDP at market exchange rates. At these rates, per capita GDP nonetheless remains below the world average. The Bank committed to China around $1.7 billion for 14 projects this fiscal year, of which three were carried over from the previous year. About 76 percent of ongoing Bank-financed projects in China show a strong focus on the environment."
2011,"The Bank's partnership with China now emphasizes economic analysis, policy advice, technical assistance, and training. For example, the Bank is working with China's Development Research Center of the State Council, together with the Ministry of Finance, to prepare a joint report that develops a policy agenda for rapid and sustainable growth in order for the country to transition to a high-income economy."
2011,"Latin America and the Caribbean experienced one of the strongest periods of growth in a century between 2002 and 2010, fueled by the longest and most comprehensive commodity price boom in history and huge increases in exports to China. Growth quickly rebounded from the global recession and reached 6 percent in 2010. As a result, more than 50 million people were lifted out of moderate poverty between 2002 and 2008, and for the first time, inroads were made to alter persistent economic inequality. Solid growth of 4-5 percent is projected for 2011."
2011,"The Bank Group has been focused on events in the Middle East and North Africa this year, where we have seen the impact and challenges posed by citizens demanding change. The region's people deserve a new social contract that gives them a bigger say in their future, justice, and jobs. Our rapid response draws on learning, experience, and flexibility—while recognizing the long-term challenges. Thus we are emphasizing shortterm job creation connected to long-term job investment; boosting trade to strengthen investment; and targeted safety nets to ensure the most vulnerable are not forgotten. To help the Arab Republic of Egypt and Tunisia, the Bank Group announced up to $6 billion in new support over the next two years."
2011,"We see rapidly expanding South-South exchanges of financial resources, development experience, and trade and investment opportunities. The Bank Group is learning from these exchanges, and increasing our efforts to expand new knowledge, financial innovation, and fresh approaches to all poor countries. Our strong Treasury team is keeping funding costs low, and passing on the benefits to clients."
2011,"Given the high level of economic integration in the region, greater cooperation—on water and energy, transport, trade, corporate finance, and social inclusion—is essential. The Bank supported the Southeastern Europe Energy Community in establishing a common regulatory framework for energy markets and helped craft regional transport solutions to meet EU transport requirements."
2011,"The Bank's Reimbursable Technical Assistance program expanded in fiscal 2011 as programs in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia grew and new programs began in Bahrain and Qatar. The Bank is working on macroeconomic and fiscal capacity and labor markets in the United Arab Emirates, and its program in Oman reflects a growing emphasis on education. In Qatar the Bank is working on a portfolio to enhance macroeconomic and fiscal management capacity and on business and trade facilitation."
2011,"This fiscal year the Bank met with members of the civil society advisory group on the Bank's health portfolio, with young Arab leaders on the democratic movements in the Middle East, and with high-level representatives of the International Trade Union Confederation. It also conducted a series of formal consultations with CSOs on the Bank Group's strategies for the environment, education, performance standards, and trade. The most extensive of these meetings was on the first phase of the Bank's energy policy, which involved Internet-based consultations and meetings with more than 2,000 people in 31 countries. The Bank also provided grants to thousands of CSOs worldwide through dozens of grant mechanisms and community-driven development funds. CSOs were involved in the preparation of 81 percent of all new Bank-financed projects during fiscal 2011."

The plan also aims to support the transition to a low-carbon economy—especially in Brazil, China, India, Mexico, and South Africa — by increasing analytical, knowledge, and investment support. The plan also seeks to assist countries as they adapt to climate variability and change by providing for analytical work and for development of risk-management instruments and othertools and methodologies. The goal is not just to increase investments but to ""climate proof"" them as well."
2007,"partners continue to be limited. Trade between Africa and Asia’s two largest countries, China and India, represents an enormous opportunity because it involves far more than natural resources and is opening the way for Africa to become a competitive processor of goods and services to these countries. But for Africa to proactively seize these opportunities within the developing world, it is imperative that countries pursue rigorous reforms not only at their borders but, more important, “behind their borders.”"

Cambodia, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Mongolia, and Vietnam also grew rapidly, increasing theiroutput by 7.5—10.5 percent. Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand grew at more moderate but still healthy annual rates of 5-6 percent. Papua New Guinea and some of the Pacific Islands also saw a pickup in growth, in part as a result of higher commodity prices. Political or civil unrest undermined the outlook in Timor-Leste and Tonga."
2007,"In China, an Investment Climate Assessment of 120 cities found that cities vary widely in local governance, investment climate, and progress toward achieving a ""harmonious society""—the objective of China’s 11th National Five-Year Plan. The report concluded that cities with the weakest investment climates stand to gain most by making their local governments more efficient, transparent, and investor friendly."
2007,"The emergence of avian influenza in Southeast Asia in 2003 placed the region at the forefront of a global response to the disease. Vietnam, where the Bank assisted in developing the first Avian Influenza Emergency Response Project, continues to inform global practice with a second operation, the Avian and Human Influenza Controland Preparedness Project. In fiscal 2007, avian Hu projects were delivered for Indonesia and China using the Avian and Human Influenza Facility. Similar projects have been proposed for Cambodia and Mongolia."

2007,"Research in fiscal 2007 addressed key concerns of citizens in the region, such as job security, poverty, and crime and violence. A report on informality in Latin America examined the nature of the informal sector and its implications for workers, firms, and policy makers. A study on remittances found that for each 1 percent increase in remittances as a share of GDP, the fraction of the population living in poverty falls by a modest 0.4 percent. A report on the region’s response to the growth of China and India found that competition from Asia has a positive effect on the region as a whole despite adverse effects on some countries and industries.

It was followed by Europe and Central Asia, which received $3.3 billion (26 percent) in funding, and East Asia and Pacific, which received $2.8 billion (22 percent). Lending was more concentrated than in fiscal 2006. Whereas in fiscal 2006, 52 percent of total lending went to the five largest borrowers, in fiscal 2007, combined commitments amounting to 56 percent of total lending went to the five largest borrowers—Argentina, China, India, Turkey, and Colombia."

2007,"Under certain circumstances, IBRD would be able to continue to lend to a borrower that was reaching the single borrower exposure limit by entering into an arrangement that would prevent its net exposure from exceeding the limit. Any such arrangement would need to be approved in advance by IBRD's Executive Directors. As of June 30, 2007 IBRD had entered into one such arrangement with China. As of this date, China had not reached the single borrower exposure limit and therefore, activation of this arrangement was not required."

2007,"The World Bank Group needs to be a strategic partner to clients, donors, and those that are both. It should be a development innovator in fragile states and those struggling to come out of conflicts. It can be a designerand implementer of local solutions to global challenges of the environment and disease, while serving as a steward of our natural environment and a first responderto climate change. It must be a facilitator of rules, institutions, and markets that can tap trade and finance for people in developing countries seeking hope, opportunity, and the dignity of personal enterprise."
2007,"In March 2007, the Bank President initiated a broader look at the Bank’s long-term strategy. This review, which will be the first sustained review since the current twin pillars strategy was adopted in January 2001, will be led by the Chief Economist The papers and reports that the Board considered in fiscal 2007 included such topics as trends in official development assistance; progress in the Bank’s Africa Action Plan; progress with the Clean Energy for Development Investment Framework; implementation issues surrounding debt relief, including development of a comprehensive framework for the settlement of protracted arrears cases; and progress on global trade, specifically the Doha Development Agenda and Aid for Trade. The Board also discussed the Bank’s policy for rapid response to crises and endorsed a new framework for strengthening the Bank’s engagement in fragile states. On the governance and anticorruption (GAC) agenda, Executive Directors supported the principles of transparency, predictability, consistency, and equity of treatment across member countries. They also reaffirmed their engagement and oversight during implementation of the GAC agenda. With respect to the External Review Committee on Bank-Fund Collaboration, Directors noted the importance of effective collaboration between the Bank and the International Monetary Fund."
2007,"The World Bank uniquely must adapt to these changes while staying loyal to its vision: a world free of poverty. It pursues this end by focusing on its areas of comparative advantage, supporting client countries’ pursuit of sustained and equitable economic growth. The Bank’s support includes knowledge services, financial services, and strategy and coordination services. Additionally, the Bank advocates the adoption of prodevelopment policies around the world, particularly in relation to trade."

2007,"macroeconomic management and trade policy, according to the World Bank’s Country Policy and institutional Assessment ratings. Africa now needs to sustain such gains by continuing to improve the policy environment, in particular by ensuring macroeconomic stability and improved market efficiency. Doing so will require greater openness to trade as well as the formation of strong market institutions. Removing behind-the-borderconstraints and establishing a procompetitive domestic business environment would enhance international competitiveness and strengthen domestic capacity to respond to the changing demands of the global economy (box 2.2)."

2007,"South Asia is sitting on a rich potential source of growth: regional integration. Increasing integration within the least integrated region in the world could yield huge benefits for its people. Annualtrade between India and Pakistan, currently estimated at $1 billion, could potentially reach $9 billion. Unfortunately, progress on trade integration within South Asia has been slow. While it continues to make the case for more open trade in goods and services within the subcontinent, especially with private sector entities such as national federations of chambers of commerce and industry, the World Bank is also focusing on regional cooperation in energy and water, where the win-win benefits are likely to be even higher"
2007,"The Bank’s analytic work is increasing knowledge and sparking debate on high-priority development topics through in-depth studies and advisory activities on such crucial issues as employment, trade, regional labor migration, and corruption. The most recent flagship report, Migration and Remittances: Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union, shows that migration within and from the transition economies of Europe and Central Asia has been significant and will likely continue to increase. The report, which focuses on circular migration patterns, also looks at migration policies in the region and makes recommendations for improving them."

In Egypt, Bank-supported reform ofthe business environment resulted in the creation of a ""one-stop shop"" at the GeneralAuthority for Investment. By bringing together 20 government entities under one roof, the time and cost of obtaining licenses for investment projects is reduced in order to match international best practices and thereby boost investment. The Bank is also supporting the privatization of banks in Egypt. In Morocco, the Bank is supporting financial sector reforms.

Sustained growth has lifted 50 million people out of poverty each year for the past five years. With just 8 percent of the population living below $1 a day, East Asia has the chance to reduce absolute poverty significantly by 2010. Much of the region's poverty reduction has resulted from rapid growth in China, which in turn has increased exports from China's neighbors. The region's exports have almost doubled over the last three years. Despite the highest real oil prices in more than 25 years, growth in 2005 has been only moderately affected. Several countries, most notably Indonesia, have taken action to reduce costly and regressive fuel subsidies while also encouraging consumers and firms to adapt to higher oil prices."

In collaboration with the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), the Bank is working to achieve peace and stability, both of which are needed to accelerate growth, attract foreign investment, and increase exports. In fiscal 2006, the Bank began disbursements from two multidonor trust funds for the reconstruction of Sudan. Torn apart by 21 years of armed conflict, Sudan is one of the countries where the Bank works toward economic recovery and reintegration of former combatants into society under the Low-Income Countries under Stress Initiative.

The programs funded trade facilitation, regional approaches to HIV/AIDS, private sector development, regional power systems, telecommunications, transport, health, tertiary education, agricultural research, migratory pests, food security, transnational environmental issues, and the weather-related vulnerability of rural communities. In Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda, the Bank funded programs to facilitate regional trade and transport systems, focusing on railways in particular. The Bank also extended support to Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Guinea, and Mali for a project to improve air transport safety and bring the industry closer to full compliance with the safety standards of the International Civil Aviation Organization."
2006,"The Bank's strategy for the region is to support broad-based economic growth, promote trade and integration, enhance the environment for good governance, increase social stability, and achieve the Millennium Development Goals. To help reach those goals, the Bank approved $3.4 billion for the region in fiscal 2006, $1 billion in IDA credits, $84.5 million in IDA grants, and $2.3 billion in IBRD loans.

Countries have used the opportunities presented by this wave of economic growth to press ahead with reforms. The new government in the Arab Republic of Egypt is engaged in a range of reforms affecting the financial sector, the investment climate, social protection, education, and urban renewal.

The available line of credit to each institution is $500 million, but usage from both institutions cannot exceed this amount in aggregate. The line of credit facility is being used to cover any overnight overdrafts that may occur due to failed trades. At June 30,2006, IDA had not drawn down under this facility ($nil — June 30,2005)."
2006,"At June 30,2006, $103,604 million (58.1%) of the uncalled capital was callable from the member countries of IBRD that are also members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). This amount exceeded IBRD's outstanding borrowings including swaps at June 30,2006. Table 13 sets out the capital subscriptions of those countries and the callable amounts."

China has until August 1, 1960 to complete the necessary action."
1959,"It is true that the external accounts of these countries benefited during the past year from a substantial increase in the volume of their exports, but their terms of trade did not show a similar recovery. Also, in a number of countries better economic management brought benefits both to investment programming and to the balance of payments. But the structural problems remain serious. Burdensome surpluses continue to depress the market for several commodities on which many less developed countries rely for their earnings of foreign exchange. Some countries face heavy debt schedules on earlier borrowing. And the demand for external long term capital remains at least as strong as ever."
1959,"low-income countries. Between 1955 and 1958 the aggregate foreign debt of these countries increased by more than 60% and the indications are that a further sharp rise took place in 1959 in the debt of several of the Bank's member countries in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. (A study of this subject, entitled Debt Servicing Problems of Low-Income Countries, 1956-1958, by Dragoslav Avramovic and Ravi Gulhati, was published for the Bank in July, 1960, by the Johns Hopkins Press.) Although most of these countries still possess a margin for further borrowing on conventional terms, there is a growing realization in the industrial countries of the need to export development capital on terms which will not bear as heavily on the balance of payments of the poorer countries. Fortunately, there are signs that some of the industrial countries will be able to export capital on an increasing scale. The Western European countries as a whole generated a sizeable trade surplus during 1959, enabling them to reduce their outstanding debt to the United States and to the International Monetary Fund at an accelerated rate; some of these countries, as is discussed below, also began to explore new ways of increasing their contribution to the flow of capital to low-income areas, and thereby supporting Western Europe's traditional role as an important supplier of development capital. Also, notwithstanding pressures on its balance of payments and a further out-flow of gold from its reserves, the United States continued to be the largest single source both of capital and technical assistance for the less developed countries, disbursing approximately the same amount of financial assistance during 1959 as in the preceding year."
1959,"bring them into line with current requirements. Having been founded as a central instrument of the European nations which were participating in the Marshall Plan, oeec created special machinery for the liberalization of European trade and payments, and played a considerable part in European economic recovery. Now that many of its initial tasks have been discharged, it has been suggested that oeec should embark on new activities, including work in the field of development financing, and that its membership should include the United States and Canada."

About half the Congo's foreign trade is handled by otraco, as well as substantial local traffic, otraco is using the loan for the further modernization and improvement of its facilities which have been expanded in the 'fifties, partly with the aid of previous Bank loans for the Congo's development program. The total cost of the present otraco program is estimated at the equivalent of $20 million, about half of which is being spent on imports of rolling stock, river craft, port and other equipment and various materials."

1971,"CHINA: Bank, April 1971—$55 million, 500 MW reserve unit (total cost, $73.2 million)."
1971,"The terms of private loans are also relevant to the debtor country. The grant element in export credits, not to mention bonds issued by developing countries and commercial bank credits, is clearly very much lower than that in official assistance, and for many of the ""middle income"" developing countries which use these sources of funds most heavily—Argentina, the Republic of China, Greece, Iran, Mexico and Venezuela are examples —the grant element in the total flow is inevitably rather low. However, the terms on which capital has been made available to most individual developing countries have been reasonably in line with the productivity of capital and ""transformation"" possibilities in the countries concerned."
1971,"To summarize trends in the net flow of resources in these categories in absolute terms since 1965: private financial credits have more than doubled; bonds and other private flows have shown little change; private suppliers' credits have almost tripled; DAC ""other official flows"" have quadrupled; multilateral loans have increased by roughly half; net loans from Sino-Soviet countries are estimated to have declined slightly (and in any case comprise only about 5% of the global net flow); net DAC official development assistance loans have increased by about 30%; and the flow of grants has increased by about 10%. In other words, while the flow of resources in those categories with a relatively high concessionary element has grown very slowly or not at all for the past few years, growth in most of the ""hard term"" categories has been rapid and, from all indications, appears likely to continue unabated, at least for the immediate future."

A management training institute and six adult training centers will be built and equipped. Equipment will be provided for 30 schools for technicians, 12 practical trade schools, a technical teacher training college, a science equipment production center, and an educational film, radio and television center. In addition, the project includes funds for foreign fellowships and technical assistance in developing curricula, introducing new teaching methods and modernizing equipment production."
1971,"The project in Nepal combines finance for construction with technical assistance to improve administration and road maintenance. Nepal is an extremely poor country that presses up the southern slope of the world's highest mountains between India and Tibet. More than 80% of the 11 or 12 million Nepalese live by small-scale agriculture, producing two thirds of the country's total output; the other third comes from cottage industries, construction and trade. Per capita income is among the world's lowest, and production has been rising barely fast enough to keep pace with population growth. The primary need is for the integration of small, isolated valley economies, for which a prerequisite is improvement of the transport system. A basis for this was provided in 1965 in the form of a detailed five-year transport program resulting from a Bank-financed study. Various parts of this program have been carried"
1971,"developing countries facilities are grossly inadequate to meet the growing needs of trade, agriculture, industry and government."
1971,"Another example is found in Indonesia, where an IDA credit was approved in July 1970 to assist part of a five-year expansion program drawn up with the help of a technical mission provided by Australia. Good telecommunications facilities are especially important to Indonesia's trade and development because of its geography: the archipelago it occupies embraces more than 6,000 islands stretching in a chain some 3,000 miles long. Existing telecommunications facilities were wholly inadequate and costly to operate, and there were serious deficiencies in management and control. The Government's program is designed to help overcome these and other shortcomings."
1971,"As larger issues appear over the horizon of development, the Bank attempts to lay the foundation for an adequate operational response by conducting more basic studies employing all available techniques of research and analysis. For example, the staff began a broad examination of employment and income distribution and their relation to development. It is hoped that the study will throw new light on the magnitude of the unemployment problem and methods of combatting it, on the ""trade-off"" between employment and growth of production, and on resulting policy issues. The result of one such project was nearing completion as the fiscal year ended. It is a programming study of Mexico, which attempts to analyze the relationships between the project, the sector and the whole economy, employing a system of inter-related programming models for each level. A similar study of the Ivory Coast is under way. The object is to sharpen existing tools and develop new methodology which might provide better answers to questions confronting both the Bank and its member countries, such as possible conflicts between growth, on the one hand, and employment and income distribution on the other."
1971,"ment problems of general concern. In 1969, the Bank was requested by the Trade and Development Board of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), to ""consider working out arrangements for supplementary finance and, if appropriate, to consider introducing them."" This referred to possible arrangements to cushion the impact on development programs of unpredictable shortfalls in earnings from primary commodity exports, and resulted from a study conducted by the Bank at UNCTAD's request in 1965. The Pearson Commission had also urged that the adoption of such a scheme be expedited. Lacking any indication that funds required would be available beyond those provided for regular development assistance, however, the Bank advised UNCTAD in August 1970 that it would defer further detailed consideration of such a proposal. The matter was discussed by the Executive Directors in April 1971, on the basis of a renewed request from UNCTAD that the Bank pursue its efforts to work out the details of a scheme of supplementary financing and to assess its probable cost. It was agreed that the problem would be kept under review, and meanwhile that the Bank would examine on their merits any cases of hardship that might arise from shortfalls in export earnings."
1971,"The problem of converting part of the output of an investment into foreign exchange to service foreign debt is not unrelated to the availability of financially viable projects in the borrowing country. But there are some aspects which warrant separate consideration. The balance of payments adjustment mechanism rarely works as smoothly in developing countries as it does in developed. In part, this is because factors of production tend to be less mobile in developing countries than in developed, and changing the orientation of men and machines from one geared to the domestic market to one geared to the international is, as a result, a long and difficult task. In part also the adjustment mechanism works less smoothly because, when the re-orientation is accomplished, developing countries often find that the products they are most suited to produce for international markets are those faced with a low elasticity of demand, quantitative import restrictions or high tariffs. There is an obvious danger in sweeping predictions about the terms of trade of developing countries as a group, but it does seem clear on the basis of past experience that the prices of commodities such as textile fibers, rubber, sugar and tea are likely to deteriorate rather sharply if developing countries substantially increase their sup-"
1971,"In preparing its study of the external indebtedness of developing countries, the Bank staff devoted particular attention to making an assessment of the long-term debt servicing prospects of some 30 developing countries, together accounting for approximately 80% of the outstanding external debt of all developing countries. By their very nature, analyses of this kind are fraught with uncertainty: a change of political conditions, a monsoon failure, a new mineral discovery, any of these or many less striking events can change a country's debt servicing prospects significantly in a very short period. Though the projections made took into account expected changes in export prices, they could make no allowance for the possible effects of an accelerated rate of inflation in world markets, or for substantial changes in foreign trade and exchange rate policies. Despite the difficulty of generalization in the field of debt servicing prospects, it appears on the basis of this sample that most developing countries fall into one of three categories."
1971,"A considerable number and variety of aid coordination groups now exist under various sponsorships. The most visible are the consortia, consultative groups and other formal aid coordination bodies, and country reviews carried out by the Inter-American Committee on the Alliance for Progress (CIAP). The Bank is chairman of two consortia, the Aid Croup for Ceylon and 13 consultative groups. The Bank is a member of the Consortium for Turkey, sponsored by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and of the Inter-Governmental Group for Indonesia (IGGI) under the chairmanship of the Government of the Netherlands; it also provides staff support for these, for the country review exercises conducted by CIAP, and for groups convened by the Governments of Guyana and Honduras."
1965,The net flow of official assistance from the industrial countries (including the Soviet countries and mainland China) to the developing countries and to multilateral institutions remained rather static at
1965,"The Soviet countries and mainland China are reported to have disbursed in 1965 approximately $500 million of aid to the developing countries, about the same as in 1964."
1965,"The scope of such aid has been gradually expanding, although so far it has been chiefly in the form of technical assistance and, in some cases, in financing exports to the recipient countries. It has been directed mainly to those countries with which the aid donors have special ties or physical proximity. Among IDA's Part II members, Ireland, Israel, Jordan, Mexico, Panama and Yugoslavia have released all or part of the national currency portions of their subscriptions in usable form, in addition to their initial payments of 10% in U.S. dollars. A number of developing countries have participated in technical assistance activities of the international agencies. The non-industrial countries which have achieved a measurable level of aid are Brazil, the Republic of China, India, Israel, Kuwait, Mexico, Spain, U.A.R., Venezuela and Yugoslavia."

The specialist teams consist mostly of agricultural experts working on farming demonstration missions in Africa. Doctors, nurses and engineers have been"

1965,"PRELIMINARY STEPS WERE TAKEN during the year toward outlining a multilateral scheme for insuring foreign investments against other than normal business risks. At the request of the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD, the Bank staff in 1962 had studied in considerable detail the issues involved in establishingsuch a scheme. In 1964, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) requested the Bank to undertake a further study of ways in which features of national investment guarantee schemes could be adapted to a multilateral approach.

1965,"Apart from its assistance to individual member countries, the Bank also conducts or sponsors studies which are of broad general interest in the field of economic development. In December 1965, the Bank staff completed and transmitted to the United Nations another of the studies which it had been requested to undertake by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). The study, ""Supplementary Financial Measures,"" was published at the same time by the Bank. It outlined an international scheme to provide supplementary finance to support development programs that"
1965,"would otherwise be disrupted by the failure of export earnings to come up to reasonable expectations. The UNCTAD Committee on Invisibles and Financing Related to Trade established an intergovernmental working group to examine the staff study and prepare a report for further discussion by the Committee, with a view to presenting it for consideration at the next meeting of UNCTAD. The Bank has agreed to assist in the additional work required. Other Bank studies still in progress on behalf of UNCTAD concern the nature, use and effects on development of suppliers' credits and, as mentioned earlier in this Report, the feasibility of a multilateral system of investment insurance."
1965,"WORLD PRODUCTION, TRADE AND FINANCE"
1965,"Prospects of the developing countries are strongly affected, of course, by trends in world production, trade and finance. In 1965 and the first half of 1966, the expansion that has characterized world production and trade since 1960 continued, although international trade increased at a slower pace in 1965 than in the two previous years of exceptional growth. The slowdown in exports began in the second half of 1964, and was more accentuated for the developing than for the industrial countries. The trend turned up again in the latter part of 1965 and the first half of 1966. On a global basis, trade expanded by about 8% in 1965, as compared with the exceptionally high rate of 12% in 1964 and the average increase of 7% for the period 1957 to 1963. World gross domestic product (GDP) grew in 1965"
1965,TRADE AND RESERVES OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
1965,"Compared to the rate of growth of world trade as a whole, however, the growth of exports of the developing countries has lagged substantially and almost continuously. This has been due chiefly to the predominance of primary products in the developing countries' exports. As recently as the period 1962-64, almost 85% of the export earnings of the developing countries were derived from primary goods, while the same group of products accounted for only about 44% in value of total world merchandise trade. Manufactures, on the other hand, accounted for about 56% of total world trade, but for only 15% of the export earnings of developing countries."
1965,"For primary products the growth in volume of both world consumption and international trade has tended to be relatively sluggish. In addition, the longer term trend in prices of primary commodities has shown a gradual decline. In the 10 years 19533 to 1963, the world's export volume of primary commodities grew at around 5.3% per year, while the price level dropped about 4% over the period as a whole. Manufactured products on the other hand grew in volume at 6.8% per year, with the price level at the end of the period about 8% higher than at the beginning."
1965,2 The figures on trade and reserves in the following section of the Report exclude Spain because the very rapid growth in its imports and the extreme changes in its payments position would have concealed the trends of other developing countries.
1965,"Of course, different products have fared differently and this has been reflected in variations in the growth of exports of individual developing countries. On the basis of price movements, developing countries dependent primarily on agricultural products, particularly coffee, tea, cocoa, sugar and fibers, fared worse in 1965 than those dependent on minerals, but the relative position of some of these commodities strengthened in the early part of 1966. The more modest growth of industrial output in Europe and Japan in 1965 was accompanied in Europe by a decline in textile production. These factors undoubtedly had an unfavorable effect on both the export trade volume and prices of agricultural raw materials from developing countries."
1965,"was a certain amount of support for both volume and prices in international trade in ferrous and ferrous-alloy minerals. For some of the non-ferrous and non-metallic minerals (except petroleum), supply difficulties were a constraint on the potential growth of trade volume, but they were more than offset by the consequent increase in price levels, especially in the case of copper and tin."
1965,"The relatively slow growth of imports has been a major factor in the gradual decline of the combined trade deficit of the developing countries from an average of more than $4 billion a year during 1960 to 1962 to about $2.5 billion during 1963 and 1964 and to some $2 billion in 1965 (Table 2). The trade deficit of the developing countries as a group, however, is greatly reduced by the inclusion of major petroleum exporters with a larger trade surplus. Excluding them, the combined trade deficit was $7.3 billion in 1965, about the same as the average for the years 1960 to 1964."
1965,"ing new obligations, especially in the form of suppliers' credits. Another influence was action by creditor countries in limiting the volume of lending, particularly of credits on hard terms, to certain countries in acute debt positions. An improvement in the trade balance has helped several countries limit their recourse to higher indebtedness. A number (including Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Chile and Korea) raised their export earnings rapidly. Some (including Brazil, Colombia, Chile and Korea) also curtailed import demand by slowing down inflation."
1965,"the Government has recently offered scholarships to about 1,000 foreign students peryear. It has also approved medium-term credits to finance purchases in Yugoslavia by various developing countries in Asia and Africa, chiefly the U.A.R., India, Indonesia and Sudan. By the end of 1965, the cumulative amount of such commitments exceeded the equivalent of $300 million, of which only a part has been disbursed. Additional suppliers' credits have been provided by Yugoslav exporters with the assistance of the Yugoslav Bank for Foreign Trade."

By the end of the fiscal year, the World Bank had established additional consultative groups for Malaysia and Thailand, and had taken preliminary steps toward organizing similar groups for Korea, Morocco and Peru. In connection with proposals for cooperative efforts in Latin America, discussions were held with the Inter-American Committee on the Alliance for Progress (CIAP) and IDB to assure that any new consultative groups in the hemisphere would coordinate their efforts with those of the Alliance for Progress."

1964,"Acceleration of growth, nevertheless, appears to have been quite widespread. Countries that have been showing particularly good growth during the last few years include the Republic of China and Thailand in Asia; Tunisia and Libya in Africa; Israel and Iraq in the Middle East; Greece, Spain and Yugoslavia in Southern Europe; and Mexico, Peru and Venezuela in Latin America. Growth rates, on the other hand, have been very low in a number of developing countries including Indonesia, Ceylon, Tanzania, Togo, Mali and Haiti."
1964,"Manufacturing grew at an annual rate of some 7% in both 1963 and 1964 (see Table I). In some countries the increase in industrial production was concentrated in heavy industry, but in others the main emphasis, which was economically justifiable, was on the expansion of light industries. In both, development has been oriented toward substitution for imported manufactures, exports accounting for only a small part of production. The share of manufactures in the total exports of the developing countries, including exports to other developing countries, is still only about 10%. While learning to produce and sell manufactures abroad is very difficult, countries like Yugoslavia, Israel, Mexico, and the Republic of China have already demonstrated the benefits for growth at home that such exports can provide."
1964,"The level and composition of investment, of course, are important determinants of growth. While the productivity of investment shows significant differences among countries, the more rapidly growing economies have generally shown higher ratios of investment to total output. Thus, in Israel, the Republic of China and Yugoslavia, gross investment over the 1957-1962 period amounted to some 30% of gross national product. The ratio was 17% in Latin America and less than 13% in most countries of Asia and Africa. It should be stressed, however, that some countries which have had low investment rates—India, Pakistan and a number of African countries, for instance—have been raising them in recent years."
1964,"Aid from the Sino-Soviet countries is now around 5% of the whole. Their net disbursements are estimated to have increased from $300 million in 1961 to $400 million in 1962, $425 million in 1963, and perhaps around $500 million in 1964. Disbursements have grown steadily, but commitments show large fluctuations, rising in the years from 1958 to 1960, and then declining to 1963. In 1964, commitments by the Sino-Soviet countries increased fivefold over the previous year, and reached a peak level of $1.5 billion. The Soviet Union has been the largest creditor of the group; but its share has diminished from some 85% in 1959 to approximately 60% in 1964. The remainder originated about equally in the eastern European countries and in mainland China."

The group covers 1,500 million people or 70% of the population of the world outside the Sino-Soviet countries."
1964,"The capacity to pay for imports is an important constraint on the rate at which a country can grow. If the future growth in external earnings of the developing countries is not rapid enough their capacity to import will be held down, unless there is an offsetting increase in the capital made available to them. Here the record of the last few years has not been very encouraging. Total private long-term capital invested in the developing countries reached a peak in 1957 at $3.4 billion and has since remained below this point. The disbursements of the total net official flow of long-term financial resources from the developed countries (outside the Sino-Soviet area), after a sharp rise at the end of the 1950's and the beginning of the 1960's, in 1964 were slightly below the 1961 figure. Net disbursements by international institutions, however, rose both in 1963 and 1964. An increase is also believed to have taken place in Sino-Soviet disbursements, as well as in exporter credits from all countries, in 1964. The total net flow of finance (private, official bilateral and funds made available to multilateral institutions) in 1964 was about $9.5 billion. At the same time, payments of interest, dividends and profits by the developing countries to the industrial ones rose sharply and were over 40% of the total net capital flows."
1964,"developing world (excluding the 1,000 million people in the Sino-Soviet countries), outstanding public and publicly guaranteed debt with a maturity of one year or more rose from $18 billion at the end of 1962 to $21 billion at the end of 1963, and preliminary estimates give a total of $25 billion for 1964. Over the last two years, the annual rate of growth in debt was about 17%, compared to 15% between 1955 and 1962. (The impact of this continuous increase in debt on debt service is discussed below.)"
1964,"While the data are still incomplete, the evidence so far available indicates that financial assistance from developed countries (including the Sino-Soviet countries) to developing countries directly and to international development institutions, after a substantial rise in the latter part of the 1950's, has increased little over the past four years. The amount of assistance from these countries, net of capital repayments, has now reached $9.5 billion a year*; it has come mostly from public sources."
1964,"Aid from the Sino-Soviet countries is now around 5% of the whole. Their net disbursements are estimated to have increased from $300 million in 1961 to $400 million in 1962, $425 million in 1963, and perhaps around $500 million in 1964. Disbursements have grown steadily, but commitments show large fluctuations, rising in the years from 1958 to 1960, and then declining to 1963. In 1964, commitments by the Sino-Soviet countries increased fivefold over the previous year, and reached a peak level of $1.5 billion. The Soviet Union has been the largest creditor of the group; but its share has diminished from some 85% in 1959 to approximately 60% in 1964. The remainder originated about equally in the eastern European countries and in mainland China."
1964,"The official bilateral financial flows from the developed world outside the Sino-Soviet countries to the developing countries totaled about $6 billion both in 1963 and 1964. While the figures were the same in these two years, their composition changed somewhat: U. S. disbursements declined from $3.8 billion in 1963 to $3.5 billion in 1964, while those of the U. K. and Germany increased. Disbursements by France remained on the level of the previous year."
1964,"group operates, discussed in Part Two of this Report. Work continued on the studies undertaken by the Bank at the request of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. One of them, relating to the so-called ""Horowitz Plan,"" was completed and forwarded to the United Nations."
1964,"For at least a decade, the Bank has been increasingly concerned with the rising burden which the service of external debt is placing on the balance of payments of the underdeveloped countries (see page 57). During the year, The Johns Hopkins Press published for the Bank a study, ""Economic Growth and External Debt,"" by Dragoslav Avramovic and other members of the staff. The study showed, among other things, that in the period 1955-62, the public and publicly guaranteed debt of a representative sample of developing countries more than doubled, and that amortization and interest payments on this debt more than trebled. This study was an outgrowth of staff work undertaken in response to requests from the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the Secretariat of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)."
1964,"The year 1964 was a good one for the world economy. World industrial output rose by 7%, compared with the postwar average of 5%. The value of recorded international trade increased by 12%, as compared with 9% in 1963 and an average of 7% between 1950 and 1962."
1964,"In the developing countries,1 output rose nearly as fast as in the industrial countries, at a rate between 4% and 5% in 1963 and 1964; but the absolute figures were much lower: total national product rose from around $170 billion in 1960 to some $200 billion in 1964. As a result of rising demand in the industrial countries, the value of exports of the developing countries rose by 9% in both 1963 and 1964, compared to an average of about 3.5% between 1950 and 1962. The prices of their exports rose after a decline which had lasted seven years, and since there was little increase in the prices of their imports, their terms of trade improved considerably."
1964,"The recovery in trade provided much needed help to the developing countries by raising their capacity to import. Their aggregate import volume had risen at a rate of only 2% per year in the period 1957-1962; and since population grew at 2.5%, imports per capita had in fact declined. The upswing in commodity prices enabled the developing countries to increase their import volume by 3% in 1963 and by 5% in 1964."
1964,"The Bank has been concerned for a long time with the problems of fluctuations and sluggish growth of external earnings of developing countries. These two subjects were in the forefront of the deliberations of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development last year. At the request of the Conference, the Bank is currently examining the feasibility of establishing a mechanism which would assist countries hurt by shortfalls of external earnings below reasonable expectations to avoid disruption of their development programs. It is generally accepted that, if development programs are to be executed as planned, supplementary assistance in some form will be needed in many cases to offset the effects of unfavorable developments in external trade."

Over half the Fund's loans were for the metals, furniture-making and textile industries. The bulk of the remainder was for food processing, non-metallic mineral products, printing and publishing, chemicals, electrical machinery, paper, and footwear industries."

1964,"The amount of international financial assistance available to the underdeveloped countries is limited, and the need for better use and coordination of external aid continues to be urgent. The Bank took its first major initiative to assist in the coordination of aid in 1958, when a critical shortage of foreign exchange threatened to undermine the development program of India. A group consisting of the Bank and the capital-exporting countries most directly concerned was organized to surmount the crisis by mobilizing an adequate flow of external assistance. In 1960, a similar consortium was organized by the Bank for aid to Pakistan. These consortia have met annually since their inception. Both have served as vehicles for objective comments on the economic performance and capital requirements of the recipient countries, and have served to coordinate external aid and improve the terms on which it is given. The Bank is also a member of consortia on Greece and Turkey administered by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development."
1964,"6 Sizable differences exist between the figures for the developing countries' balance of payments deficits on current account (see p. 56) and the total capital movements which finance them. The differences are largely due to omissions, errors and inconsistencies in reporting, and to the fact that some of the developing countries (particularly oil producers) were adding about $1 billion to reserves in 1963/1964. The World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development are engaged in a cooperative effort to make the reporting of the data more complete and more uniform."

About half this total has been committed during the last two fiscal years. Eleven commitments totaling $79.9 million were made during the year under review to ten countries, five of which—Cameroon, the Republic of China, the Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone and Spain—received loans or credits for education for the first time.

The project also involves measures of curriculum reform designed to strengthen the teaching of technical and agricultural studies, and agricultural and workshop training. Other projects approved during the year included a $9 million Bank loan to the Republic of China for industrial and vocational schools, and for feasibility studies of educational television and fisheries education; a $6.5 million Bank loan to Colombia for comprehensive secondary schools; and a $12 million Bank loan to Spain for basic general education and teacher training centers."
1970,"A major aim of Bank Group power lending is institution building within the power sector. The development of well-managed, efficient power authorities can be fostered by the provision in loans or credits to new borrowers of finance for organizational improvements or staff training— as in the case of the IDA credits to Indonesia and Malawi—or through relationships built up over the years with existing borrowers. The Bank and IDA value such relationships, both because they assist the process of institution building, and because they enable the Bank and the borrower to evolve and adapt on a continuing basis agreed long-term programs for the expansion of the power sector as a whole. Apart from the loans to Mexico and Brazil mentioned above, loans or credits for projects which form parts of ongoing programs of system improvement and extension were also made to Argentina, Ceylon (2), the Republic of China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cyprus, Honduras, Panama and Thailand during the year."

1970,"Both national governments and the World Bank have emphasized improved taxation as the main method of domestic resource mobilization for economic development. The average tax ratio for most developing countries for which figures are available appears to have increased to about 16% of national income in recent years (see text table on page 54). In several countries (e.g., Brazil, Chile, the Republic of China, Israel and Mauritius) yields from taxes, expressed as a percentage of GNP, are close to, and in some cases as high as, those of developed countries. Furthermore even low-taxed countries not separately shown in the tables have in most cases experienced marked upward movements in their tax ratios."
1970,"There are no complete, comparable and systematic data as to the degree to which various developing countries have been able to advance the •formation of their financial systems, in terms of their economic development and the diversification of their financing requirements. For illustrative purposes, a number of countries have been chosen, for which certain data could be assembled. Annex Table 3 indicates the relative importance reached by these countries' banking and non-banking financial institutions in the course of the past decade; the table shows the percentage of gross national product represented by currency, liabilities of commerical banks and non-banking institutions, and claims on the private sector. In a number of these selected countries (Colombia, Costa Rica, Israel, Morocco, Tunisia) demand deposits have become more important than currency in domestic transactions, reflecting the leading role and acceptance of commercial banks as key institutions in their financial systems. Moreover, obtainable data for some of these and other countries (Republic of China, Honduras, India, Mexico, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, United Arab Republic), indicate that non-banking financial institutions are complementing commercial banks in a significant way."
1970,"The development picture was marked by a number of encouraging advances during the year.

1970,Recent Trends in Trade and Growth of the Developing Countries
1970,Recent Trends in Trade of Developing Countries
1970,"World trade in 1969 recorded an impressive increase of 13% by value, surpassing even the high rates of growth previously experienced in 1964 and 1968. The exports of the developed countries increased by 15%. The developing countries, whose rate of trade expansion has typically been slower than that of the developed countries, attained a 9% rate of export growth during the year (compared with almost 10% in 1968—see text table, page 44). Reflecting these developments, total world exports (including those of centrally planned countries) achieved a level of $270 billion in 1969, of which $48 billion represented the exports of the developing countries. If present indications are borne out, 1970 may prove to be a third successive year of noteworthy expansion in the export trade of the developing countries. This expansion has been related to the high levels of economic activity in developed countries, which have in turn been reflected in the higher prices for many primary commodities experienced in 1969."
1970,"The share of developing countries in world exports declined slightly in 1969, from 18.5% to 17.7%, and accounted for somewhat more than 40% of all exports of primary products and 6% of all manufactured exports. An analysis of world trade by origin and destination (see Annex Table 2) confirms the prevailing trends of the past decade: the expansion of developed countries' exports has been absorbed by the developed countries themselves; the trade flow of developing countries is increasingly directed toward the developed countries; and the proportion of developing countries' exports to other developing countries has been gradually shrinking. Market economy developed countries import about three-fourths of the exports of developing countries, and the proportion of developing countries' trade represented by exports to other developing countries has been reduced (from 21.5% in 1961-65 to 19.5% in 1969). This is particularly true of Asia and Africa, where regional trade declined from 23% and 7% of their total trade in 1961-65, to 20% and 6% respectively in 1969. Only in the case of Latin America have exports toward other developing countries increased (from 18% to 20%), reflecting an expansion of trade within the region (from 8% to 12%)."
1970,"Apart from the removal of trade barriers in the developed countries and the grant of non-reciprocal preferences to exports of manufactures and semi-manufactures from the developing countries, another possible way of accelerating the export trade of the low-income countries, as noted by the Pearson Commission, is to expand trade among these countries themselves. The experience of regional trade arrangements suggests that the prospects for trade expansion are best between countries which are geographically close to each other and linked by good communications networks, rather than between countries which form parts of wider regions, or between different regions. For example, intra-regional trade among the Latin American Free Trade Association (LAFTA) countries in the 1960s has not exceeded the level reached in the mid-1950s, before the creation of the Association. Intra-regional trade rose sharply, on the other hand, among the Central American Common Market countries, from 7% of their total exports in 1960 to 25% in 1967; such trade accounted for 18% of the East African Community's total exports in 1965-67, marginally above the level in 1960-62. Manufactured products have a dominant position in the intra-regional trade of both these regions."
1970,"Trade expansion has been sustained, over the past year, by rising prices. The World Bank maintains an index of commodity prices, based on price quotations for 38 primary commodities which account for three-quarters of the total exports of the developing countries. The index reached a ten-year high in 1969 of 107 (1960-62 = 100) if petroleum exports are included, and of 118 excluding petroleum. Factors which contributed to this situation included a continuation of the four-year rise in cocoa prices, which reached a record high for the decade in 1969; the negotiation of the 1968 International Sugar Agreement, which came into effect in January 1969; an increase in coffee prices"
1970,"Economic factors helping commodity price increases in 1969 included generally rising price levels in the United States and the strong economic expansion in Europe and Japan. Nevertheless, many countries have been unable to profit from these developments because a number of commodities which figure importantly in their trade have continued to face weakening markets. Prices of rice have been drifting downward from their unusually high levels; those of wool and hard fibers have been particularly weak in recent periods. Prices of tea, iron ore and manganese ore have continued to decline for a decade now; cotton prices on the other hand, although lower than in 1968, are generally being well maintained."
1970,"The behavior of commodity prices in 1969 was reflected in a continuation of the gradual improvement in the terms of trade of the developing countries which has been registered in most years since 1962. The regional impact of this favorable development was uneven, however, owing to the geographical concentration of production of the"
1970,"commodities which were the main contributors to the increase in prices—coffee, cocoa and non-ferrous metals. Consequently, Latin America and Africa experienced conspicuously favorable terms of trade, whereas those for Asia, which had been declining throughout the past decade, failed to"
1970,"As the staff of the IMF pointed out in a major study on the subject published earlier this year,3 a number of factors underlie this steady expansion of commercial credits extended to the developing countries. Among the more important have been the increasing competition for export mar-, kets among the industrialized countries, the growing volume of world trade itself, the growing demand for capital goods in the developing coun-. tries (coupled with limited access to international capital markets and the limited supply of untied development assistance), and the liberalization of exchange, credit, and credit insurance policies in the DAC countries. There is less understanding, however, of the role of private export credits in development finance. On one hand there is general agreement that under appropriate circumstances, such credits constitute a significant addition to the financial resources available to the developing countries. On the other hand, resort to this type of financing can become excessive, and lead a developing country into an untenable debt situation."
1970,"Considering these recent developments in the volume, composition and terms of the flow of financial resources to the developing countries, the immediate outlook for global development finance is not altogether clear. As a natural concomitant to the economic development and growth in trade of the developing countries, foreign direct investment and access to private export financing have continued to grow rapidly. Although external financing at concessionary terms from official sources, both bilateral and multilateral, has been rising in absolute terms, its rate of growth has been slower than the economic expansion of the major capital exporting countries. In addition, the grant element of total official commitments has shown no pronounced tendency to increase. At present, there is little to indicate that these trends are likely to be altered in the immediate future."
1970,"external economic situation, the World Bank is utilizing to an increasing extent quantitative analytical techniques and models. Various debt projections have been constructed with the help of the Bank's debt data base and computer routines for purposes of internal analysis. Adequate interpretation of projections such as these would be beyond the scope of this Report. Although it has •long been accepted as a general proposition, this work confirms the crucial role of the composition and terms of capital flows to the developing countries. Moreover, the analysis provides a measure of the magnitude of the international effort which would be needed simply to maintain the present level of net resource transfer to the developing countries, much less to increase it as their trade and investment requirements grow over the next decade. In addition, it suggests that the debt service problems facing a number of developing countries are likely to grow more difficult during the next few years if recent trends in capital flows, aid policies and development performance remain unchanged. Globally, both the gross domestic product and export earnings of the developing countries have continued to expand. External debt and debt service requirements have increased more rapidly, however, while during the past few years the net flow of external capital has tended to level off and the terms at which it is obtained to become somewhat harder. Several developing countries, including some of the largest, have felt it necessary to seek partial relief from existing debt service obligations in recent years. It is clear, therefore, that the debt situation of the developing countries will continue to require the careful attention of the international financial community."
1970,"Another important potential source of increased tax yields is the agricultural sector. The introduction of technological changes in farming, combined with improved domestic terms of trade for agricultural products in many developing countries, have sharply improved opportunities for higher farm incomes in certain portions of the agricultural sector, which consequently both can and should bear a larger share of the tax burden. Agricultural taxation is often complicated, however, by contrasting policies: on the one hand exemptions or lower income tax rates may be applied to farm income, while on the other hand such benefits may be offset by other factors which tend to reduce farm earnings; in some cases these include regulated low domestic prices and overvalued exchange rates for agricultural exports, which reduce overseas sales of farm products."
1970,"proportion of underemployed urban workers will have to find work in traditional service occupations. One element in policies to mitigate this problem would be a concentrated effort to upgrade the quality of ""human capital"" through job-oriented educational programs, which could facilitate the process of integrating unskilled urban labor forces into the urban economy. Moreover, it is essential that foreign trade and subsidy policies which make scarce capital artificially cheap relative to labor be considered with respect to their impact on the urban employment problem."
1970,"productive activities. In the longer run, however, its service sector may well be the chief determinant of the competitiveness of a city's output. With the growth of a national economy, involving demand for new products and specialization in production, an industrial complex may grow which both trades with other areas and provides goods for the large market of the city itself. The large urban center can offer important economies of scale for productive trade and industry, and for public sector activities. It can also generate so-called ""external economies"" in the form of inter-industry linkages, pools of skilled labor, finance and research."
1958,"The Bank was also active in assisting various member countries to organize or operate development banks. Representatives were sent to Paraguay, Peru and China (Taiwan) to advise on the establishment of new banks or on the reorganization of existing banks in those countries. The Bank also participated in the planning of the new Industrial and Mining Development Bank of Iran, which is being sponsored by Lazard Freres of New York and The Chase International Investment Corporation. A staff member of the Bank was lent as adviser for one year to the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India.

1999,"The share of people living on less than $ 1 per day (at 1985 purchasing power parity) fell slightly, to 29 percent of the developing world's population, between 1987 and 1993 (the latest year for which a global total is available). The numbers of poor, however, rose. As of 1993, the South Asia Region had the most poor (515 million persons or 39 percent of the total). The last two decades (to the mid-1990s) saw an extraordinary decline in poverty in East Asia, from some 60 percent to 20 percent of the population (and a halving of the numbers). Further dramatic improvement was recorded in China in the late 1990s. But much of the rest of East Asia has seen partial reversals, taking poverty rates back to levels experienced earlier in the 1990s."

1999,"The events of the past two years have lent new urgency to China's dual-track reform of state-owned enterprises and banks, begun before the crisis. Lagging internal consumption and increased unemployment threaten continued growth. Vietnam is pursuing similar reforms with mixed results to date. However, its efforts to modify trade laws and to reduce and simplify import barriers and export rules are a significant step forward. Vietnam is one of the countries piloting the Comprehensive Development Framework approach, which brings together economic, structural, and social issues in support of the government's next five-year plan, with heavy reliance on donor coordination."
1999,"Thus far, more than 50 activities have been approved from the asem Trust Fund, costing a total of $33 million in the seven recipient countries—China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, South Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam.

A follow-up loan and a skills development project are also addressing jobs, unemployment, and training needs. In transition and small economies, the Bank is focusing on public expenditure reviews and advice on the structure of social spending. Specific economic and sector work is being conducted in China, Vietnam, and Cambodia."
1999,"Activities in FY99 reflected concerns about the impact on poverty of some of the year’s pivotal issues: persistent conflict in some of the poorest African countries; the sudden impoverishment of millions in East Asia as a consequence of the financial crisis; the continuing pain of transition in former socialist economies; and the tenuous situation of the millions of poor who live in India and China. These themes will be brought together in a major new synthesis of the underlying determinants of poverty reduction in the World Development Report 2000/2001, and a subsequent policy paper will discuss implications for the Bank’s policy and operational work."
1999,"The Bank also supported pension reform in Russia, Moldova, Macedonia, and, through a pilot project, China. Capacity is being built through widespread dissemination of prost, the Bank’s pension modeling software, with training for government clients worldwide, including Croatia, Mexico, Nicaragua, Poland, Romania, Tanzania, Thailand, and Zambia, with intensive on-site training in Brazil, Hungary, Morocco, and Russia. The model is also being used in Korea, Namibia, Philippines, and Sri Lanka."
1999,"Projects approved by the gef Council and the Bank Board in FY99 continue to propose creative and innovative actions at the local and national levels to address global environmental problems. For example, a $35 million gef grant to China will help local photovoltaic and wrind companies expand production and lower the costs of renewable energy equipment. An $11 million grant to the governments of Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam will help these countries share and jointly protect the water resources of the Mekong River Basin. In Peru, a $ 10 million grant will support the involvement of indigenous peoples in protecting biodiversity resources in the Peruvian Amazon. Finally, a $31 million grant to Russia, supplementing earlier gef grants, will help the country comply with its international treaty obligations to phase out the consumption of ozone-depleting substances (ods)."
1999,"Innovative projects to help developing countries phase out the use of ods were implemented under the Montreal Protocol. The Bank has met its commitment to phase out 70 percent of total ods under this agreement, using only 40 percent of the budgeted funds. The Montreal Protocol program also successfully developed a sectoral approach in China and auction programs in Chile and China. The closure of chlorofluorocarbon production facilities in China was an important milestone in the history of the Montreal Protocol and the associated Multilateral Fund. In addition, the government of Thailand was the beneficiary of the first concessional loan program provided under the Fund."

1999,"For the fourth year in a row, most African economies continued to grow, despite the slowdown in world trade and reemergence of civil conflict in several countries. First-round effects of the Asian crisis were more muted on the continent than elsewhere, except for South Africa. Domestic economic activity is also growing, in food production, small-scale enterprises, and intra-African trade. These beginnings of economic diversification show an Africa changing not only at the top but also at ground level—in local communities, among farmers and entrepreneurs. Most important, growth reflects sustained government efforts to improve the climate for investors, better manage public resources, and promote private sector provision of key services."
1999,"In many African countries, income per head today is still lower than it was at independence 20 or 30 years ago. The poor are growing in number each year. Without greater trade and private investment, faster growrth will be elusive, and Africa’s role in the world economy will remain marginal. Africa accounts for 10 percent of world population but only 1 percent of global gdp. Less than one twentieth of the $210 billion in capital that flowed to developing countries in"

1999,"With its population growing at about 3 percent a year, Ghana needs economic growth of 8 to 10 percent annually to significantly reduce poverty levels. Growth has averaged less than 5 percent over the last decade. To accelerate private investment and growth, Ghana must consciously develop and consolidate its ‘‘competitive advantages"" and cater to export markets. The Trade and Investment Gateway Project is designed to help remove the constraints to development of trade and exports and to attract direct investments for industrial and infrastructure development. It is part of the Ghana Vision 2020 Program that envisages, by that year, middle-income country status for Ghana and equitably shared growth."
1999,"Anticipated benefits. With project support, private foreign and domestic investors will face reduced uncertainties and transaction costs associated with doing business in Ghana, more ready sites will be available for export processing industries, and trade procedures will be simplified. The project would also benefit the heal population, by creating more job opportunities and improving the skills and mobility of the labor force. The project's favorable impact on foreign direct investment—with firm commitments of $900 million targeted by end-2002—should also have a positive effect on Ghana's balance of payments."
1999,"In FY99, the Bank continued to support policies promoting greater private investment. Reforms that open up markets, ease access to capital, simplify business codes, and enhance property rights are the gateway to higher investment—by small farmers and entrepreneurs, not just large enterprises. Under the Ghana Trade and Investment Gateway Project, the Rank will help Ghana complete its already advanced reform agenda to boost investment in its Export Processing Zone (Box 2-1). Without better governance, moreover, other efforts to attract private investment will bear little fruit."

India’s growth was 5.8 percent, compared with some 7 percent in the mid-1990s. Pakistan achieved 3.0 percent growth, a figure reduced by a foreign exchange and debt crisis provoked by the sanctions, which may have prevented some trade and temporarily halted most foreign capital inflows.

Balance of payments financing gaps of countries bordering the Kosovo region are expected to increase substantially in 1999, as are extraordinary budget needs. As the situation normalizes, these negative trends are expected to reverse gradually, but extraordinary financing needs are likely to remain high for some time."
1999,"In collaboration with the IMF, eu, donor countries, and other partners, the Bank responded comprehensively and rapidly to the needs of countries affected by the Kosovo crisis. Support included emergency financing assistance to help close balance of payments and budgetary gaps so that countries could maintain vital expenditures and continue reform efforts.

While prudent policy responses in the region following the Asian crisis limited contagion effects and allowed the region to grow at 5.5 percent in 1997, with capital inflows sustaining growth in the first half of 1998, the Russian debt moratorium in August 1998 disrupted capital flows to the i..\c Region."

1999,"These enduring issues framed the components of the Bank’s strategic response to countries’ needs during FY99. Central to this response, as in previous years, has been support for wide-ranging economic reforms to promote faster private sector-led gdp and employment growth. Because most mna domestic markets are small, opening up economies to intraregional and international trade is critical, requiring not only reduction of conventional trade barriers but also institutional, legal, and regulatory reforms to enhance the enabling environment for domestic and overseas businesses. While growth is central to alleviating poverty, Bank strategy also emphasizes special assistance for vulnerable groups. The Bank has long supported human capital investment in the region, stressing especially qualitative improvements in health and education services.

1999,"Investments: Investment securities are classified based on management’s intention on the date of purchase. Securities which management has the intention and ability to hold until maturity are included in the Held-to-maturity portfolio and reported at amortized cost. Securities designated for other postretirement benefits are carried and reported at market value or at their estimated fair values. The changes in the values of the securities designated for other postretirement benefits are included in the determination of net income. All other investment securities are held in a Trading portfolio and classified as an element of liquidity in the Statement of Cash Flows due to their nature and IBRD’s policies governing the level and use of such investments. Investment securities and related financial instruments held in IBRD’s Trading portfolio are carried and reported at market value. Unrealized gains and losses for investment securities and related financial instruments held in the Trading portfolio are included in income. Derivative instruments are used in liquidity management to take advantage of profitable trading opportunities and as a proxy for cash securities. These instruments include short-term, over-the-counter foreign exchange forwards, currency swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps, and exchange-traded futures and options on fixed income instruments. These derivatives are carried at market value. From time to time, IBRD enters into forward contracts for the sale or purchase of investment securities; these transactions are recorded at the time of commitment."
1999,"IBRD uses derivatives in its borrowing and liability management activities to create synthetic debt instruments to take advantage of cost saving opportunities across capital markets and lower its funding costs, to delink the time at which its borrowing costs are fixed from the timing of the actual market borrowings, and to establish an appropriate match between the currency and interest rate characteristics of its assets and liabilities. These instruments include currency and interest rate swaps, swap spread-locks, foreign exchange forwards, exchange-traded futures and options. These derivatives are used to modify the interest rate and/or currency characteristics of the borrowing portfolio and are linked to the related borrowings at inception and remain so throughout the terms of their contracts. The interest component of these derivatives is recognized as an adjustment to the borrowing cost over the life of the derivative contract and included in Interest under Borrowing Expenses on the income statement. Upon termination, the change in the derivative’s market value is recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of the underlying borrowing and recognized as an adjustment of the borrowing cost over the remaining life of the borrowing. In instances where the underlying borrowing is prepaid, the change in the associated derivative’s market value is recognized immediately as an adjustment to the cost of the underlying borrowing instrument and accordingly in the determination of net income. Currency swap payables and receivables are recorded on a historical cost basis and are separate items on the balance sheet. The notional principal on interest rate swaps is treated as an off-balance sheet item."

The purchaser of an option pays a premium at the outset to the seller of the option, who then bears the risk of an unfavorable change in the price of the financial instrument underlying the option. IDA invests only in exchange-traded options. The initial price of an option contract is equal to the premium paid by the purchaser and is significantly less than the contract or notional amount. IDA does not write uncovered option contracts."

1999,"The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (oecd) and the Bank have a long tradition of fruitful collaboration, and the recent financial crises, their repercussions on the progress and welfare of people in many developing countries, and their implications for global prospects all underline the need to take this collaboration still further. The Bank and the oecd are currently exploring ways of enhancing the scope and effectiveness of cooperation at the working level. Areas for potential enhanced collaboration include the broader partnership agenda arising out of Strategy 21, corporate governance, social safety nets, and sustainable development. In addition, the Bank will continue its active work with the oecd, both through its leadership in the poverty and environment working groups and through the World Development Indicators (wdi) annual reporting of progress toward the International Development Goals."
1999,"Focusing on results and outcomes requires good quality national data on education indicators, with international comparability. The Bank’s education statistics central database is now fully established and operational, providing staff with current education data for strategic planning and effective project design. Several other activities aim to improve the quality of internationally comparable education indicators and build national capacity in education statistics. Bank assistance supported developing-country participation in the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement’s Third International Mathematics and Science Study and in the World Education Indicators pilot project of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The Bank has also provided technical and financial support to establish a new Institute for Statistics under the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization and continues to be involved in the preparation of the Education for All (efa) 2000 Assessment."

Under the HIPC Debt Initiative, development credits identified for sale to the HIPC Debt Initiative Trust Fund are written down to their estimated net present value using currency specific Commercial Interest Reference Rates (CIRRs) published monthly by the OECD. Using the six months average CIRR as a discount rate provides an alternative estimate for the grant element.

1966,"The Bank and IDA together extended $75 million in 1966/67—$60 million from the Bank and $15 million from IDA—to development finance companies in Iran, the Philippines and Turkey. All three had previously received assistance from the Bank Group. To June 30, 1967, the Bank Group had provided a total of $565 million for 25 development finance companies in 21 countries—Austria, China, Colombia, Ethiopia, Finland, Greece, India, Iran, Israel, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Malaysia, Morocco, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, Spain, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey and Venezuela. These development finance companies in turn had undertaken investment commitments of over $1,700 million, chiefly in industries such as textiles, food products, chemicals and fertilizers, iron and steel, machinery and equipment, and pulp and paper. They have also provided their clients with technical and managerial assistance and, by underwriting new issues of industrial securities, have assisted in the development of capital markets."

1966,"While external resources available to the developing countries have remained inadequate, their ability to absorb capital efficiently has improved. The record is by no means uniformly good. Some countries have failed to take the measures necessary to put their development on a sound basis. Many of them, however, have come to appreciate the need for better economic performance if development is to proceed successfully. Many have made improvements in various aspects of economic policy affecting domestic resource mobilization, private investment and production activity, the programming of government investment, exchange rates and trade. They have also taken steps to improve economic administration and the identification, planning and execution of investment projects. The need for emphasis on expansion of agricultural output has gained wider recognition, and more countries have taken measures to allocate greater resources to this purpose and to frame and implement policies designed to stimulate and facilitate expanded produc-"

It is too early to assess the full implicationsforthedeveloping countries of the so-called ""Kennedy Round"" agreements which were negotiated among the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) members reducing tariff barriers, though it is clear that they should help to foster world prosperity by encouraging a more economic international division of labor in the production and trade of the industrial countries. Improvements in world markets for exports from developing countries will be a critical factor for economic development."
1966,"In recent years there has been growing awareness that the successful application of development finance can take place only in an environment with a sufficient degree of political stability, and with expanding foreign trade and proper domestic economic policies. Thus, more rapid development depends only in part on adequate and dependable assistance on appropriate terms. It also calls for the modification of trade policies in order to improve world markets for exports from developing countries. And it requires a more determined and better sustained effort bythe developing countries to improve the management of economic affairs and to give development the highest priority."
1966,"There seems to have been a close relationship between growth rates and the expansion of external trade in the various regions. Areas which achieved more rapid growth—Southern Europe, the Middle East and East Asia—have also had fairly high rates of increase in exports and imports. On the other hand, South Asia and those African countries for which comprehensive data are available have been lagging in growth of both GDP and external trade."
1966,Trade and Payments of Developing Countries
1966,"Total merchandise exports of developing countries rose at an annual rate of about 6.5% between 1960 and 1965 (Table 3). Exports to the Western industrial countries and Japan, which account for three-quarters of the total, increased approximately 6% in 1966, or about the same as in the previous five years. Exports to Soviet countries rose by about 16% per year between 1960 and 1965, but they still represent only 8% of the total. Despite widespread emphasis on the expansion of intraregional trade among developing countries, the expansion of such trade has not exceeded the growth of total exports. During that period, exports from developing to industrial countries increased at a"
1966,"rate 20% higher than the latter's GDP. On the other hand, the growth of exports of developing countries was considerably slower than the expansion of trade among industrial countries and of over-all world trade."
1966,"The relatively slow growth in the export trade of developing countries reflects their heavy dependence on primary products. In volume, their sales of these commodities increased by 5.5% per year during 1960-65, as against an expansion of 9.5% per year in the export volume of manufactured goods. The average price level of primary commodities did not change between 1960 and 1966, in contrast to a rising trend in the average prices of manufactures. In a few primary commodities, notably petroleum but also iron ore and tropical timber, the value of trade has increased during the postwar period at rates comparable to those for manufactured products, but their contribution to aggregate export earnings of developing coun-"
1966,tries has been offset by the slow growth of trade in most other commodities.
1966,The combined trade deficit of develop-
1966,"ing countries, excluding Southern Europe, was about $1.2 billion in 1966, the same as in the three previous years (Table 3). This deficit is greatly reduced by the inclusion of major petroleum-exporting countries, which have large trade surpluses. The combined trade deficit of all other developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America has fluctuated around $5.5 billion in the last few years."
1966,"Taking into account net receipts on private transfers of about $1.1 billion, the aggregate current account deficit for all developing countries is estimated at about $6.2 billion in 1965. This deficit in essence was the counterpart of a net inflow of official and private capital. Capital flows to developing countries are discussed in some detail later in this chapter; their role in the balance of payments, however, can be seen from Table 4, which is an attempted reconciliation of trade, capital and payments data for 1965. Net official"
1966,"Problems associated with suppliers' credits have been reviewed in some detail by the World Bank staff, in a study prepared at the request of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and submitted in early 1967. It was found, on the whole, that suppliers' credits have played a useful role in development finance, enabling creditors to increase exports of equipment and providing debtors an additional source of finance for investments. In some countries, however, their excessive use has led to unduly high debt-service payments because of maturities considerably shorter than warranted by the country's position. The ready availability of such credits has sometimes encouraged the diversion of scarce resources into low priority projects. In a few extreme cases, the burden of servicing such debt has contributed to financial crises which have required rescheduling operations (e.g., Ghana and Indonesia in 1966; Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Turkey in previous years). Some debt crises have had adverse effects on the creditworthiness of the countries concerned and thus on their access to foreign finance. The assumption of excessive credits has not been the sole responsibility of the debtor countries; export promotion among creditor countries has often led to the provision of excessive 32"
1966,"A new expanded system of debt reporting, established and operated jointly by the Bank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), came into force on January 1, 1967. The new system consolidates the activities of the Bank and OECD in collecting information on debt and international capital flows and should result in the availability of more comprehensive, reliable and up-to-date data. During 1966/67, the Bank also set up a system to report on the flows of capital and assistance from one developing country to another."
1966,"Through the first half of calendar 1966, the industrial countries experienced relatively rapid growth rates, even exceeding the rate needed to achieve the growth target set by the Ministerial Council of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in a 1961 resolution. The statement listed as one advantage of rapid growth that ""it will enable industrialized member countries to contribute more effectively to the development of less-advanced countries."" Beginning in mid-1966 and extending into calendar 1967, however, economic expansion in the industrial countries has slowed down. The short-term outlook in this respect is uncertain."
1972,"Some of the most successful development records of the 1960s were achieved in this region by Korea, the Republic of China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand and Malaysia. By contrast, there was little economic advance during most of that period in Indonesia, the area's most populous country. Contrast is also evident within most countries of the region, between a fairly dynamic private sector and a rather passive public sector with only recent and limited experience in economic intervention."
1972,"Except for the islands of Java and Bali in Indonesia, the pressure of population on resources is not yet as severe in the East Asia and Pacific area as in some other regions. Nevertheless, several developing countries in the group were among the early leaders in the adoption of national policies and programs to reduce fertility. In the Republics of China and Korea and in Singapore, birth rates have been reduced by nearly a tenth of one percent a year. Even in these countries, however, the rate of decline in fertility appears to have slowed down considerably, and greatly expanded effort may be required to maintain progress in reducing the rate of population growth."
1972,"Meanwhile, most developing countries of the area, with the exception of Indonesia and the countries of Indo-China, have managed to maintain relatively high rates of economic growth. Average annual gains in production during the latter half of the 1960s, for example, were more than 6% in Malaysia and Thailand and above 10% in Singapore and the Republics of China and"
1972,"In many countries, including Malaysia and Korea, impressive gains have been made in relatively short periods of time. Korea's concerted development effort dates only from about ""1963, after recovery from the disruptive effects of war, and Malaysia's from the early 1960s following a long period of national emergency. The growth of the Republics of China and Korea, Malaysia and Singapore has been fueled to a large extent by impressive and successful efforts to expand exports, especially of processed agricultural products and simple manufactures. Malaysia has been very successful in diversifying raw material exports, and in Korea the share of manufactured goods in total exports has risen dramatically."
1972,"of important developments on the international economic scene. Both the new United States foreign economic policies introduced in August and the far-reaching realignments ol exchange rates begun in December had extremely complex repercussions throughout the first half of 1972, which varied widely from country to country. The growth of trade appears to have slowed somewhat in 1971, both for the world as a whole and for the developing countries, but no precise trend can be discerned."
1972,"Along with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATTJ, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UN'CTAD! and other international organizations, the Bank is attempting to analyze the effect of the currency realignments not only on the export (Minings of its developing member countries but also on their debt, debt service, reserves, and import capacity. An issue of major importance for the Bank is the change, and especially any increase, in the real cost to each developing country of servicing external debt. In order to release or earn the necessary foreign exchange, imports may have to be curtailed or resources diverted so as to increase exports. It is necessary, therefore, to consider the effect of these realignments on debt in conjunction with parallel effects on external assets and other liabilities of the developing countries, as well as on their trade and overall balance of payments situation."
1972,"the last few years, can play only a marginal, though critical, role in providing the capital resources required for development. It is also clear that generalizations about developing countries — their prospects or capacity for growth, their potential for expanding trade, or their ability to carry debt —are hazardous. Each country is unique, with its own particular set of problems and possibilities, both internal and in relation to the world abroad."
1972,"The role of agriculture is beginning to be supplemented in some countries, however, by industrial development and growth of the tourist trade. Except in Swaziland, Zaire and Zambia and to a much lesser extent in Tanzania and Uganda, the exploitation of minerals has not contributed significantly to the economic growth of countries in the area."
1972,"The first stage of development after subsistence agriculture is the transition to production for the market. Since the growth of the domestic market is limited by the growth of the economy itself, any rapid increase in agricultural output requires an export market. Yet world demand for agricultural products grows only slowly, and trade barriers often limit access to foreign markets."
1972,"Association or trade agreements which have been or are being negotiated with the European Economic Community (EEC) will affect the prospects of almost all developing countries of the area. For the semi-industrialized countries of Europe, these arrangements offer an opportunity to expand the output and export of manufactures, while confronting domestic producers with the challenge of increasing competition at home as their own tariff levels are gradually reduced."
1972,"In the industrializing countries of North Africa and the Middle East, protection for domestic manufacturers oriented to local markets is likely to be retained for some time, though the advantages of a more outward orientation are beginning to be recognized. There will be greater opportunities to enter EEC markets in industrial as well as agricultural goods. In agriculture, there will be especially good prospects for fruits and vegetables, which have long been significant in Mediterranean trade because of variations in growing seasons. These opportunities and related problems were explored during the year in the Bank's economic, sectoral and project work. Special attention was given to policies and projects to strengthen the industrial sector's competitive position and further the development of export-oriented agriculture."

Various amenities will be provided, such as water for both farmers and their animals, and parking areas for bullocks and carts. Each center will be owned and managed by a Market Committee, including both farmers and traders, which will be subject to supervision by a State Marketing Board."
1972,"In order to overcome the constraints of small economies, there has been a continuing effort on the part of several groups of countries in the area lo promote trade and widen the base of economic activity through various mechanisms for regional integration. The Bank has assisted in these efforts and will continue to do so. Five countries in the area are members of the Central American Common Market (CACM): Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. The World Bank and CABEI have established close relations, with the aim of giving new impetus to industrial development within the Common Market."

1972,"Production changes in certain commodities have led to readjustments in international trade. In the past, for example, India, Ceylon and what is now Bangladesh were the traditional producers of tea. Now several African countries are also growing and exporting tea. Similarly, palm oil was once exported almost entirely from Africa. An increasing proportion of the world's supply now comes from Southeast Asia."
1972,"These and other problems associated with commodities have long been a concern of the Bank's Executive Directors and management. In a paper presented at the third United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in Santiago, Chile, the Bank pointed out that most of its projects contribute in some degree to the broad objective of economic diversification in the less developed countries. Many are aimed directly at reducing a country's dependence on a small number of traditional export commodities. Almost half the developing countries depend on a single commodity for more than half their total export earnings, and three fourths of them get more than 60% from only three primary products. (For an account of the first cooperative venture in financing for diversification, involving the Bank Croup and one of the international commodity organizations, see page 20)."
1972,"Economic activity in the developed countries continued to expand, but at a reduced rate. Measured in terms of industrial production, growth rates for members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) declined from more than 6% in 1968 and 1969 to less than 3"".> in 1970 and 1971. The slowdown in industrial activity did not affect imports of the OECD countries from the Middle East, mainly crude oil, but there was a marked deceleration, especially in 1971, in the growth rate of imports from other developing areas. It is hoped that renewed expansion will result from measures already taken and in prospect."
1972,"In the field of aid coordination, meetings of the Consultative Groups for Morocco and Tunisia, chaired by the Bank, were held in October 1971, and the Bank participated in two meetings of the Turkey Consortium, organized by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)."

For other countries, special arrangements were made for consultation on problems of particular concern with other international organizations and donor governments. Examples of specific operations involving coordination with bilateral and multilateral agencies are given in the area sections of this Report."
1973,"The expansion of EAHC ports is vital to the national economies of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda and some landlocked neighbors (Burundi, Rwanda and Zambia) which depend heavily on foreign trade for their continuing development. Previous projects financed by the Bank have considerably increased the capacity of East African ports to handle the growing volume of traffic. But the massive diversion of Zambian traffic from southern African ports to Dar es Salaam in recent years has strained the port's capacity to handle cargo. The project will raise Dar es Salaam's capacity to handle the much greater volume of Tanzanian and Zambian traffic that is expected, especially after the Tanzam railway link between the two countries, now being constructed with aid from the People's Republic of China, is completed. It will also help modernize and expand the ports in Mombasa and Tanga."
1973,"Agricultural setbacks have seriously affected economic growth in the region over the past year. During the five years from 1966 to 1971, economic development had made significant headway. The average annual increase in Cross National Product (GNP) was 4.6% in India and nearly 6% in Indonesia. Elsewhere, notably in the Republics of China and Korea and in Singapore, economic expansion, led by a rapid rise in exports, was even faster, averaging well over 10%. Aggregate growth in the region as a whole (excluding Japan) was almost 6% per year. East Asia advanced nearly twice as rapidly as south Asia."
1973,"the sharp swings periodically experienced in primary product prices. The terms of trade of some developing countries may have deteriorated, since the prices of and demand for several of their major exports have not increased to the same extent as has been the case with their imports."
1973,"1973,	the United States announced its intention to seek legislative approval for the devaluation of the dollar—for the second time in less than two years. Subsequently, adjustments in other currencies, especially the yen and Deutsche mark, have continued to take place. While no firm evidence is available as yet, it is probable that the instability and uncertainty in exchange markets during the winter of 1972-73 had some adverse effect on world trade. There are indications that the prices of some commodities may be responding to the changes in exchange rates. But it is likely to take a rather long time for the effects of all these changes to be fully worked out; and these effects will merge with those of subsequent events."
1973,"Along with the IMF, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and other international organizations, the Bank"
1973,"Realignment of exchange rates alters the nominal value of the external debt. It is only in the narrow accounting sense that all debt can be shown in U.S. dollars; in fact, the debt is denominated in about 40 currencies. To find the extent of any changes in the real cost of servicing debt that have resulted from exchange rate realignments requires careful and detailed country-by-country analysis. That analysis must extend beyond nominal changes in exchange rates to encompass numerous factors like trading patterns and the probable effects of changes in the prices of traded goods not only on trade flows but on the domestic economy as well. Such analyses are part of the Bank's continuing effort to assess the problems and to advise its members."
1973,"The expansion of EAHC ports is vital to the national economies of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda and some landlocked neighbors (Burundi, Rwanda and Zambia) which depend heavily on foreign trade for their continuing development.

1973,"The 20 countries of Western Africa include some of the poorest nations in the world. As they move into the second decade of their independence, there is a growing desire for self-reliance and for mobilizing their own limited local resources of human skills and capital. The conviction is spreading that economic expansion by itself is not enough, and that more must be done to extend the benefits of development to larger numbers of people. These attitudes are emerging despite the formidable obstacles to progress arising from the pervasive poverty of the region. The poverty to a large extent is responsible for the fact that government revenues and domestic public savings remain limited. The latter have been severely affected over the years by the deterioration in the terms of trade, although a sharp increase in the prices of such commodities as cocoa and coffee has recently improved the trade balances of some countries in the region."
1973,"transportation projects in seven countries. Of these projects, three—two in Mali and the other in Dahomey—are particularly noteworthy. In Mali, great distances separate its key development areas from the capital, which itself is about 750 miles from Dakar, in neighboring Senegal, the principal port for Mali's foreign commerce. Two IDA credits totalling $16.2 million, approved in April, will help improve the railway and highways. The railway is the only efficient link to Dakar, carrying 60% of Mali's external trade. The road system ties the main population centers and agricultural areas of the central region, and feeds into the highway networks of Upper Volta and the Ivory Coast."

1973,"The Nicaraguan sub-project is only a small example, developed in response to the emergency following an earthquake, of the Bank's interest in the rehabilitation and development of industry in the region. The interest stretches back more than 20 years, and centers on the fact that industry has played a considerable role in providing employment directly and indirectly, increasing productivity, and raising the living standards of the urban labor force. While progress in industrialization has been impressive, many problems remain. Shortages of skilled labor, management, capital resources and entrepreneurship are common. In a number of countries, domestic markets are limited; so also is access to external markets. There is a need to transform protected, high-cost im-port-substitution industries into modern, more specialized and efficient export-oriented producers. In many instances, this will require a reorientation of industrial policy, including rationalization of the structure of protection policies, adequate export incentives, and measures to avoid balance of payments disequilibrium and maximize employment growth. The feasibility of policy shifts in this direction has been confirmed by the impressive achievements of several countries in diversifying their trade structure through promotion of non-iraditional exports."

1973,"Over the past five years, the Caribbean Free Trade Association has moved rapidly toward trade liberalization among its members. The Bank plans to assess the possibilities of assisting in evolving a coordinated approach to the economic development of the region and thus gaining a better understanding of how it might help. It is also working closely with the Caribbean Development Bank so that the two institutions might expand the scope of their operations in the area."

1973,"New opportunities for stimulating exports from developing countries are receiving greater attention. For example, a staff paper on the ""Tropical Hardwood Trade in the Asia-Pacific Region"" concludes that systematic exploitation of tropical hardwood resources offers promising opportunities to foster economic development in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. Wood processing offers such countries additional advantages in that it is a labor-intensive activity providing an opportunity to industrialize remote areas on the basis of locally available resources."
1973,"The program at present consists of over 50 studies, covering a wide range of subjects. The latter include economic planning, income distribution, agriculture and rural development, trade, international finance, industry, education, labor and unemployment, urbanization, regional development, transportation, public utilities, and financial institutions."
1973,"The program includes a significant amount of research on trade and industrial policies, and on economic planning in developing countries. Studies are being made of alternative incentive systems (such as tariffs, quotas and credit preferences), industrial capacity utilization, and industrial planning. A volume on ""Multi-level Planning: Case Studies in Mexico,"" edited by Alan Manne and Louis Coreux, was published recently. Another study is intended to appraise the utility of economy-wide planning models on the basis of experience. It will consist of a series of review papers, with a common theoretical framework, covering specific planning problems in such areas as employment, trade, regionalization, and intersectoral consistency. The survey will help the Bank and its member countries in developing new approaches and techniques for country economic analysis."

Because of the redesigning of the system to supply natural gas for the plant, additions to the plant, and currency realignments, the cost estimates have increased by $22.5 million to $113.3 million. The IDA credit will cover part of the increased foreign exchange costs attributable to the currency realignments. USAID and the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan, which participated in the original financing, are also increasing their contributions."

In cooperation with the German Foundation for International Development, an agricultural projects course was held for field officers of the Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation. EDI also supported two industrial projects courses at the Center for International Studies of the University of Belgrade, and a general development course at the International Development Center of Japan. The courses in Germany and Japan were for officials and technicians associated with foreign aid programs."
1998,"Responding to the economic and financial crisis dominated the Bank’s assistance program to the East Asia and Pacific (eap) region in fiscal 1998. The Bank supported countries in their efforts to restructure their financial sectors, reform corporate governance, and provide social safely nets in the face of mounting unemployment, declining incomes and public expenditures, and rising prices for staple commodities, which primarily affect the poor. The Bank pledged some $16 billion, in addition to its regular lending program, to address the extra demands that arose from the crisis. By the end of the fiscal year, $565,000 million of this had been disbursed. Parallel to this effort, the Bank continued its regular operations, supporting clients with programs to promote economic and social reforms, reduce poverty, and build institutional capacity. In response to natural disasters, emergency assistance was extended to China, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and Vietnam."

The Bank’s Development Grant Facility (dgf) Council endorsed the first year of a multiyear program to support unicef’s education programs; in fiscal 1998 a $1.2 million grant supported small-scale innovative programs at the community and local levels to increase girls’ enrollment rates. A multi-agency partnership between the Rockefeller Foundation, the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development, and unicef is working to examine factors that hinder or facilitate the effective implementation of girls’ education projects and initiatives.

1998,"For Africa to build further on its initial successes, trade and private investment must grow. Currently, 61 percent of exports are made up of agricultural products, minerals, and metals, and only 19 percent manufactures; growth remains far too low and undiversified. Long-term private capital flows to Africa have increased from $4 billion in 1996 to $8 billion in 19972 but remain a fraction of the $256 billion total flows to developing countries. Africa must attract more investment, not only from foreigners but from Africans themselves: some 37 percent of African assets are held abroad, according to estimates—higher than any other region."
1998,"In fiscal 1998 the Bank helped its African clients, such as Malawi and Mozambique, to low'er trade barriers and increase competitiveness. In some countries, trade taxes can account for up to 40 percent of fiscal revenue, and in one example of an effort to address this, the Bank and the West African Economic and Monetary Union (wae.mu) are discussing ways to meet the transitional financial costs as fiscal policies are strengthened."

If sustained and combined with significant official financial support, this adjustment will help improve investor confidence, lift foreign investment, and build the basis for a recovery. Second, sharp cutbacks in investment spending—owing to the decline in foreign financing, weak banking systems, and tight monetary and fiscal policies—are countering positive trade developments and threatening the prospects for early economic recovery. Investment spending in the region before the crisis was high at 37 percent of gross domestic product (gdp), and a resumption of investment is crucial for recovery and growth. Even so,"

1998,"Countries undergoing transition from protected trade to international trade, and from economies dominated by mass production and heavy industry to those organized around knowledge and services, must prepare their people for employment in a market economy. The region’s educational systems are not designed to produce workers with profiles that labor markets increasingly demand. Highly specialized and rigid vocational and higher education programs, for example, must be reoriented. Public expenditures should also be rationalized to address inefficient allocations of resources within the education sector and underfunding that has arisen with greater decentralization. In response, the Bank’s support for education reform expanded significantly in fiscal 1998, with projects in Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Hungary, Macedonia, and Romania, as well as an adaptable program loan in Turkey. Two projects in Hungary are helping reform higher and vocational education, while Bank sector work is analyzing policy options for reforming Russia’s vocational educational system. Adjustment loans in Armenia and Georgia protected expenditure in the social sectors while increasing cost effectiveness."

1998,"Greater reliance on the private sector as the main engine for economic growth requires appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks to protect property rights and consumer interests. The Bank is helping governments establish efficiency-enhancing laws and regulations and institutions to enforce them. This covers a range of sectors. In Venezuela an innovative project is improving the operations of the Supreme Court, which has accumulated a large backlog of cases. A learning and innovation loan to the Dominican Republic is improving environmental management by defining policy reforms and elaborating on the National Environmental Management Program. The Bank is also providing technical assistance and sector loans to improve or establish regulatory frameworks for infrastructure development. Several studies, such as the Peru Agricultural Development Strategy', are providing recommendations on laws and regulations to improve resource allocation and enhance economic growrth. The Bank also sponsored a consultative group meeting, bringing together policymakers from throughout the Caribbean to discuss policies on labor regulation, the financial sector, and trade policy."
1998,"Despite year-to-year fluctuations in growth rates, most of the countries of the region are now participating in varying degrees in the broad-based economic recovery that has increasingly characterized the regional economy during the present decade. Nevertheless, the region still suffers from persistently high levels of unemployment against a background of rapid labor force growth, along with sharp rural-urban disparities in incomes and social and physical infrastructure. Meeting these and other critical development challenges entails maximizing regional economies’ potential for securing the rapid, equitable, and sustainable economic growth on which future prosperity and socioeconomic cohesion depend. This in turn will involve promoting private sector-led growth, liberalizing trade, privatizing state-owned enterprises, and focusing on a new role for government as an effective referee and facilitator of productive economic activity rather than a direct participant in it. Support for human development, socioeconomic inclusion, and targeted poverty reduction initiatives will also be critical, along with continuing efforts to preserve fragile or limited natural resources and the region’s unique cultural heritage."
1998,"Nonlending services, which include analytical and policy work, technical assistance, training and knowledge dissemination activities, are central to the Bank’s support strategy for the mena region. Analytical work during the year included completion of a country assistance strategy (cas) for Lebanon and the Bank’s first country economic memorandum on the West Bank and Gaza, which was prepared jointly with Palestinian counterparts. Fiscal 1998 saw not only a continuation of traditional country-based analytical work focusing on key strategic issues, such as the Jordan Water Sector Review, but also substantial expansion of comprehensive regionwide analysis—including groundbreaking multidisciplinary regional studies of education sector performance, labor markets, governance issues, and investment in cultural heritage. The Economic Development Institute (edi) supported programs designed to disseminate international best practices in fields of special concern to the region, such as water and irrigation policy, microcredit financing, and grassroots management and decentralization. Technical assistance during the year ranged widely in terms of coverage and included work on telecommunications, tourism, debt management and export development in Morocco; private participation in the power and sanitation sectors in Tunisia; and tax policy, Central Bank liability management, trade efficiency, and restructuring of state-owned enterprises in Iran."

The 1996 wto Ministerial Declaration called for a plan of action to improve the capacity of the least developed countries to respond to opportunities offered by the trading system. The wto suggested a special program for these countries because they are the poorest and, without such a program, the multilateral process of trade reform was likely to pass them by.

The Bank’s policy advice has focused on setting fair workers’ incomes, reducing health and safety risks, and setting standards for workers’ conditions—including the improvement of labor standards. In preparing the Republic of Korea’s structural adjustment loan, for example, the Bank engaged in a constructive dialogue with labor unions and supported a number of reforms to labor markets and social safety nets, including the expansion of labor standards to all workers; previously these were not applied to firms with fewer than five workers."

These instruments include currency and interest rate swaps, swap spread-locks, foreign exchange forwards, exchange-traded futures and options. These derivatives are used to modify the interest rate and/or currency characteristics of the borrowing portfolio and are linked to the related borrowings at inception and remain so throughout the terms of their contracts. The interest component of these derivatives is recognized as an adjustment to the borrowing cost over the life of the derivative contract and included in Interest under Borrowing Expenses on the income statement. Upon termination, the change in the derivative’s market value is recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of the underlying borrowing and recognized as an adjustment of the borrowing cost over the remaining life of the borrowing. In instances where the underlying borrowing is prepaid, the change in the associated derivative’s market value is recognized immediately as an adjustment to the cost of the underlying borrowing instrument and accordingly in the determination of net income. Currency swap payables and receivables are recorded on a historical cost basis and are separate items on the balance sheet. The notional principal on interest rate swaps is treated as an off-balance sheet item."

1988,"Although the external environment of growth for the developing countries began to look less difficult in 1987 than previously, policies in many countries continued to be oriented toward restraint. For middle-income countries, this restraint was reflected in a move from deficit to surplus on the balance of payments (goods, services, and private transfers) from 1986 to 1987 (Table 2-7). China (a large, low-income country) also slashed its current-account deficit. This was not true of small low-income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, whose capacity for further belt-tightening is limited; for those countries, however, the further rise in the external-payments deficit was reduced by the further decline in the volume of their imports from 1986 to 1987."

1988,"Among the larger economies of the region, a widely shared trend is the recent surge in manufactured exports. The improved performance in manufactured exports is notable both for its wider distribution in the region and the continued strength of the two more spectacular performers: China and Korea. China's recent economic growth has been boosted by its success at finding overseas markets for its exports of petroleum, raw materials, textiles, and, more recently, for its machinery. The introduction of various export-promotion measures, including tax rebates and preferential loans for exporters, a relaxation of export-license requirements, and the delayed impact of the July 1986 devaluation, helped push nonoil export growth up strongly for the second year in a row. In 1987, the value of exports, led by nonoil exports, grew by almost 21 percent."
1988,"Joining Korea and China are a number of countries that have more recently emerged as dynamic participants in the process of industrial and trade-policy reform, industrial expansion, and rapid growth in manufactured exports."
1988,Extending Reforms in China
1988,"China's rapid growth continued with a GDP increase of 9.4 percent in 1987. With the rapid import expansion of 1985 now under control, the current account returned to a position of slight surplus in 1987. These developments, combined with more effective external debt-control procedures, helped confine the growth of China's external debt below expected levels, as it reached an estimated $24.5 billion at the end of 1986. While the external position improved, domestic imbalances of varying degrees continued from 1986 into 1987. ""Investment hunger"" caused investment to remain at its high level of 38 percent of GDP in 1986, and a retail inflation rate of 7.5 percent in 1987 raised concerns about the degree of overheating and its potential consequences."
1988,"Reforms were extended to different sectors as China pursued its transition from direct planning and the central management of output to a reliance on indirect policy levers such as the exchange rate, interest rates, and tax policies. Among urban reforms, most striking are the refinements that have taken place in the system of enterprise management. As before, enterprise reform continues to stress responsibility for profits and losses, but, in addition, under the newer ""contract-management system,"" performance incentives have also been introduced through a system of annual targets for enterprise profits."
1988,"The Bank's advisory role in China is in transition from an earlier emphasis on integrated studies of the macroeconomy to more sectoral and subsec-toral issues. Lending content is shifting, as well, from the relief of infrastructural bottlenecks to more attention to institutional questions, pricing and maintenance issues, and technical assistance. Bank lending in fiscal 1988 supported operations in the areas of transport, energy, education, rural credit, and industry."
1988,"CHINA: IBRD—$200 million; IDA—$100 million. A rural-sector adjustment credit is designed to support the inception of the country's second phase of rural economic reform, whose main aims are to foster agricultural development and specialization, increase economic efficiency, encourage nonfarm rural enterprises, expand rural exports, provide productive off-farm employment opportunities, reduce agricultural and urban food subsidies, improve agricultural tax bouyancy, and improve the range and efficiency of rural financial services."
1988,"CHINA: IDA—$170 million. Through a third rural-credit project, the growth and diversification of agriculture will be stimulated and the operational efficiency of the Agricultural Bank of China increased through institutional development. Total cost: $340 million."
1988,"CHINA: IDA—$103 million. The income levels and living standards of about 122,600 households in the Nei Monggol and Ningxia autonomous regions will be improved through improvement and expansion of irrigated areas, provision of needed inputs, and the strengthening of research and extension systems. Training and technical assistance are included. Total cost: $234 million."

The Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments will be assisted in developing coastal lowlands, mudflats, and shoals for culture fisheries, thus allowing coastal dwellers to switch from the already over-exploited offshore fishing industry to mariculture and supplement their agricultural earnings through livestock and horticulture. Total cost: $217 million."

Technical assistance and training are included. Total cost: $239 million.
1988,"CHINA: IBRD—$50 million. Road capacity in the heavily congested corridor between Shaanxi province's capital of Xi'an and the important coal mining district and industrial city of Tongchuan is to be expanded by the construction of a sixty-seven-kilometer-long highway, and the rural-road network in southern Shaanxi province will be expanded, improved, and repaired. In addition, institutional strengthening to improve road planning, paved-road maintenance management, and road safety, together with technical assistance, will be provided. Total cost: $117.8 million."
1988,"According to the OECD, provisional data for 1987 indicate that non-DAC countries provided $9.4 billion in net disbursements of ODA to developing countries, a fall of $914 million from 1986. The 1987 decline resulted from lower aid disbursements by Arab and other developing-country donors. Among the latter, the OECD said, the lower level of aid was mainly due to a fall in Chinese aid, which had been exceptionally large in 1986 on account of large contributions to the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, however, continued to provide a substantial share of GNP as ODA—3.7 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively."
1988,"Great progress has been made by China. The challenge is to maintain this progress. The next five to ten years will be a difficult period of transition, as the benefits of the reform process, which is now becoming more complex and needs to be more finely tuned, are unlikely to flow as quickly as in the past few years. The Bank continues, and will continue, to lend its support to the Chinese authorities in their efforts at economic reform."
1988,"The rate of growth of world trade volume and of the market for U.S. exports has been expanding since mid 1987. Thus, increased exports from the United States, linked to that country's much-improved competitive position, are not being offset by decreases in exports elsewhere. Exports from the United States grew during 1987 and early 1988 at over 20 percent a year in volume terms, while current estimates show that world trade increased at about 11 percent from the first to the second half of 1987."
1988,"Global demand is also being supported by the continuation of considerable growth in domestic demand in the United States itself. During the second half of 1987, this annualized growth in the United States was 4 percent, and the level of demand was still rising in the first half of 1988, albeit at a slower pace. The savings rate in the United States remains low, however, and its current-account deficit (and, hence, the overall rate of borrowing from abroad) remains on a high plateau. In the first quarter of 1988, the U.S. current-account deficit was about $160 billion on an annual basis, as in 1987, even though the trade balance was improving. The priority that had been given to stability of key exchange rates as an objective of policy in the major countries began to bear fruit at the end of 1987 (see Figure 2-1). Under all these conditions, the growth rate in the supply of money and nominal GNP in the surplus countries has continued to expand, as they continue to add to their reserves."
1988,"Demand adequacy is also important for a smoothly functioning adjustment process. Japan is thus of critical importance at this stage, and the resolution of large payments imbalances within Europe, through reduction of rigidities and impediments to trade and competition, as well as through stabilization policies, is also important, not only for the future growth of Europe, but also for Africa, which has strong trade and financial linkages to Europe."
1988,"The external trade environment for the developing countries as a group did improve somewhat in 1987, considering the sizable growth of their collective export volume, the slight recovery in their terms of trade, and the consequent change in the purchasing power of their exports, which was up almost 8 percent from 1986 to 1987 (Table 2-5)."
1988,"Moreover, import volumes changed broadly in line with the purchasing power of exports, except in the oil-exporting countries, where imports did not start recovering (from a very depressed level in 1986) until late in 1987. Movements in all these indicators varied widely from group to group, depending mainly on the commodity composition of trade and geographic-export orientation. For sub-Saharan Africa, for example, the volume of imports declined again in 1987, as did the purchasing power of exports. The fall in the latter reflected a decline"
1988,"in export volume, while the terms of trade improved slightly due to a partial recovery of the price of oil."
1988,"For exporters of manufactures, however, import volume and the purchasing power of exports both rose by about 8 percent and 11 percent, respectively; the terms of trade worsened, but this factor was overwhelmed by a rise of about 13 percent in export volume. Figure 2-2 shows the divergent pattern of the purchasing power of exports of three major developing regions."
1988,"Behind the disparate movements in the terms of trade of the different groups of countries were highly divergent changes in commodity prices (Table 2-6). While the U.S. dollar price of oil recouped in 1987 about half of its loss of 1986 (in percentage terms), nonoil commodity prices for calendar 1987 in U.S. dollar terms remained somewhat flat for the second year in a row; a drop in the index of food and beverages offset the turnaround in indices for metals and minerals and for nonfood agricultural products."

1988,"The importance of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations has thus become more crucial than any earlier round. Many developing countries—now convinced of the importance of multilateral negotiations, as well as of the benefits of trade reform—are taking part in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in large"
1988,"numbers and joining in—for the first time—as full negotiators. Moreover, the inclusion of agriculture and a wide variety of other trade-related barriers in the negotiations, as well as of services in parallel negotiations outside the GATT, underlines the opportunities that success could bring."
1988,"2 The $1.5 billion figure was indicative of the need for additional action. The actual size of the additional external financial requirements (the financing gap) will depend, of course, on future economic conditions (fluctuations in terms of trade, amounts of external financing forthcoming from donors, actions on reschedulings, and so forth), as well as on the actual number of countries that may be eligible for program assistance."
1988,"India, also, has made significant economic progress in recent years. It has raised its long-term growth rate from a two-decades-old plateau of about 3.5 percent a year to over 5 percent, a result of massive investments in economic infrastructure previously made and the trade and industrial-policy reforms more recently introduced. Against great odds, the incidence of absolute poverty is also being reduced, even if it is still high. The Bank stands fully behind India's goal of eliminating absolute poverty by the year 2000, and it intends to review with the government the options for a major increase in support of the social sectors to alleviate the worst aspects of poverty in the countryside, as well as in the urban slums.6"
1988,"The IBRD does not generally trade in any currencies for its own account. Adjustments arising from translation of currencies to United States dollar equivalents do not result in realized gains or losses as would occur with actual conversions into United States dollars. Because of this, the general reserve, rather than net income, increases or decreases annually by the amount of adjustment resulting from currency depreciations or appreciations."
1988,"diminished. In the past two years, capital inflows have continued to decline. Most commodity prices have softened despite some recovery in 1987. World trade has remained sluggish. Moreover, the reform efforts in the developing countries have been diluted by increasing protectionism during this decade in the industrialized countries: By 1985, industrial countries' nontariff restrictions covered 20 percent of their imports from developing countries, and the industrial countries maintained tariff rates above 10 percent on about 10 percent of imports. These exogenous factors continue to spotlight domestic structural weaknesses that had accumulated over the years as a result of poor economic policies and weak institutions."
1988,"The Bank is also closely monitoring the effect of economic crisis and consequent adjustment on the poor—depression of output, employment, and consumption; falling terms of trade for those who pre-"
1988,"Efforts to achieve these objectives are frequently mutually reinforcing, particularly when research on the development process strengthens the basis for Bank policy and project design. But there may also be tradeoffs among the goals. Some investment in research aims to pay off quickly, and thus be immediately relevant to operational needs. For instance, research on project-appraisal methods, or on the successes and failures of structural-adjustment lending, can flow back to operations quickly. And some research investments are longer term, designed to build a better base for solving future development problems. Though this research may be less responsive to current operational needs, it is important nonetheless—for the Bank must, like its member countries, invest for the future. One task of the Bank's research administration is thus to balance the costs and benefits of short-term and long-term research."
1988,"The Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations, launched in September 1986, is of particular interest to the Bank, given the importance of the link between trade and development and the crucial role of trade-policy reform in adjustment programs negotiated with Bank borrowers. To help developing countries negotiating in the Round, the Bank has initiated a technical-assistance program that would allow countries to access up-to-date trade information and improve their capacity to analyze and evaluate such information. The program includes a handbook that analyzes issues under negotiation in the Round, as well as seminars on trade in services and agriculture. The Bank is also preparing two software packages that would"
1988,help countries assess the domestic impact of changes in their trade regimes and allow negotiators and trade policymakers to analyze problems of market access. The Bank is closely coordinating its technical-assistance efforts with those of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
1988,"Because Venezuela was declared eligible to borrow once again from the Bank in December 1986, its reimbursable technical-assistance program came to an end in fiscal 1987, as total Bank staff resources devoted to Venezuela since December 1986 are charged directly to the Bank lending program. Calendar 1987 was a transition year, with several studies—on trade policy, energy efficiency, and capital markets—brought to completion. A total of 91.2 staffweeks were expended on Venezuela during calendar year 1987. This was more than the allotted fifty-two staffweeks, but special exception was granted in recognition of the transition in the nature of the program."
1988,"fell as drought conditions returned to parts of the region, and, with the exception of oil exporters, the terms of trade declined for the region, as the prices of a number of primary commodity exports fell or remained depressed, and as the United States dollar, the currency in which most commodity prices are expressed, continued its sharp depreciation."
1988,"Despite these difficult circumstances, about half the countries in the region are implementing economic-adjustment programs that involve profound economic, social, and institutional changes. Not all of the anticipated results of reform programs have yet emerged, and benefits are unevenly spread across countries and sectors; nevertheless, significant progress has been made in improving production and trade incentives and in controlling fiscal and external deficits. The sustenance of these adjustment efforts is crucially dependent on the availability of additional resources that would permit these countries to maintain consumption and finance inputs and investments for growth. Large debt-service payments are currently compressing imports to levels well below such requirements. To help these countries, the Bank and other donors are supplementing their normal lending with special programs of assistance; in addition, several bilateral agencies are providing debt relief. (For details on the debt problems of low-income sub-Saharan countries, as well as on other measures affecting these countries during the year, see pages 35^40.)"
1988,"Western Africa. Although the terms of trade for the oil exporters in Western Africa improved by an estimated 10 percent, GDP fell as production and exports of oil fell. In Nigeria, which accounts for about 20 percent of sub-Saharan Africa's population, oil production fell by 12.3 percent, the result of lower production limits agreed to by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Agricultural output fell by 7.7 percent, reflecting poor weather conditions. These declines more than offset growth in other sectors, which responded to the far-reaching structural-adjustment program that was begun in 1986. The country's GDP is estimated to have declined by 4.4 percent in 1987."
1988,"Among other countries in Western Africa, Ghana, which launched its reform program in 1983, maintained the increase in per capita income that started in 1984—despite drought and floods that reduced agricultural output. In Guinea-Bissau and Guinea, real GDP is estimated to have grown by 5 percent to 6 percent after recent adjustment efforts. In Cote dTvoire, however, GDP is estimated to have fallen by more than 2 percent (after two years of sustained growth) because of a sharp decline in its terms of trade. And in Togo, economic growth was only 2 percent, while in Benin, GDP declined."
1988,"Eastern and Central Africa. The fall in coffee prices, combined with the depreciation of the United States dollar, resulted in a 20 percent to 45 percent decline in the terms of trade for a number of countries in Eastern and Central Africa. In some, however, economic growth was satisfactory (between 4 percent and 5 percent), partly because of vigorous government policies that increased price incentives, introduced more realistic exchange rates, and provided for increased inputs. In Uganda, for instance, following three years of economic"
1988,"contraction and the introduction, in 1987, of a recovery program supported by $89 million in IDA and African Facility funds, production of food, export crops, and manufactures all increased markedly. A recovery program also contributed to the first increase in per capita output in a decade in Tanzania. In Kenya, recovery in manufacturing and tourism generated growth of over 5 percent. In other countries—Burundi and Zaire, for instance— growth was more modest, in the 2 percent-to-3 percent range, while in Rwanda, there was no growth. The fall in terms of trade contributed to a substantial deterioration of the budgetary and bal-ance-of-payments situation in most of the countries of this subregion."
1988,"• Sao Tome and Principe, which devalued the dobra by 55 percent, liberalized trade, and abolished most price controls and the monopoly of state trading companies. With a focus on incentives for export crops, the adjustment program has placed several large nationalized cocoa estates under private management."
1988,"• Mozambique, which initiated the first phase of its rehabilitation program embodying policy reforms covering the exchange rate, the trade system, and pricing and distribution structures. These reforms marked a major departure from the past economic structure of centralized administrative control."
1988,"The process of structural adjustment was interrupted or delayed in a couple of countries, however. In Somalia, the foreign-exchange auction was abandoned, and price controls were reimposed; and, in the absence of a comprehensive reform program, Zambia continued to impose controls on exchange rates, prices, and trade."
1988,"In Guinea, following removal of domestic price controls in 1986 and an eightfold increase in the price of rice imports financed by aid, the area under rice in the lower coastal zone is estimated to have expanded by as much as 30 percent during the period 1985-87, while in Madagascar, liberalization of the rice trade, combined with a limit on cheap rice imports, raised production by 9 percent in 1987. Better producer incentives are likely, in the medium term, to increase private investment in the sector, as well. (Thus, in Guinea and Ghana, investment is taking place in new coffee bushes and replantings of cocoa.)"
1988,"Progress on exchange-rate adjustment has also been significant. Real effective exchange rates are substantially lower than the high levels of the early 1980s in virtually all countries of sub-Saharan Africa, particularly those that have made adjustment efforts (see Table 6-3). In some of these countries—Nigeria and Guinea-Bissau, for instance— exchange-rate depreciation (combined with trade reform) has had visible effects on efficiency in manufacturing activity and growth of nontradi-tional exports. However, a number of countries that have the CFA franc as a currency have experienced an appreciation of the real exchange rate in recent years (by about 7 percent during 1984-87), partly because the French franc, to which their currencies are tied, has appreciated with respect to the United States dollar. This appreciation has reduced incentives for export farmers and manufacturers of non-traditional goods."
1988,"Fiscal discipline has often lapsed as a consequence of a decline in external terms of trade, unexpectedly large demands from state marketing boards, and, in some cases, unwarranted government expenditures. Thus, in Cote d'lvoire, a 13.5 percent loss in terms of trade in 1987 increased the budgetary deficit by 6.3 percent of GDP, thus reversing five years of adjustment efforts that had restored key macroeconomic balances; and, in Kenya, after a reduction from 10 percent of GDP in fiscal 1981 to 4.6 percent in fiscal 1984, the deficit increased to 10.5 percent in fiscal 1987 as a result of a steep rise in expenditures (increases in civil-service wages and employment, increasing demands from crop-purchasing agencies, and defense-related expenditures)."
1988,"Many structural changes have helped the poor-increases in farm-producer prices, for example— but others have not. Increases in consumer prices, reforms in the public sector that lead to reductions in public employment and expenditures in the social sectors, and reforms in trade and exchange rates that change relative prices can all cause transitory unemployment and declines in real income for some. While the cost of not adjusting are heavy, the hardships that groups adversely affected by adjustment undergo are very real. Efforts, therefore, have increased to mitigate these costs for the most vulnerable by implementing compensatory programs, and, in the medium and long term, by fostering greater participation of vulnerable groups of people in the process of economic growth."
1988,"In addition, two Bankwide task forces (with a special focus on Africa), on poverty and on food security, are preparing agendas for action to mitigate not only the transitional costs of adjustment, but to address the longer-term issues of chronic insufficiency of income and nutrition, as well. While recognizing that per capita income growth is an essential element of a food-security strategy, the second-named task force has recommended that systematic efforts be made to identify the groups at high risk of malnutrition and develop action programs in individual countries. These programs would give priority to cost-effective projects (and policies) that might raise the incomes of people too poor to buy adequate amounts of food (even if they involve some trade-off with growth), develop ways to stabilize nominal incomes and prices, improve preparation and response to emergencies, and increase the effectiveness of food aid. The action program has not been conceived as an initiative for the Bank alone, but as a partnership of concerned donors and agencies."
1988,"Korea's economy boomed in 1987 for the second year in a row. The continuation of favorable developments in exchange rates, interest rates, and oil prices enabled Korea to achieve a 12 percent growth rate, a substantial current-account surplus of $10 billion, and a reduction of external debt by about $8 billion. The appreciation of the nondollar hard currencies relative to the Korean won, in particular, contributed to increases in Korea's exports and market share in the industrialized countries and to consolidation of two product lines, automobiles and electronics. The Bank focused on Korea's trade and monetary-management issues in its economic work in 1987, while its lending program continued to support the country's investment needs through two loans in the transport sector."
1988,"Joining Korea and China are a number of countries that have more recently emerged as dynamic participants in the process of industrial and trade-policy reform, industrial expansion, and rapid growth in manufactured exports."
1988,"with impressive performance in manufactured exports, which, in the past year, grew at a buoyant 25 percent in value (over 10 percent in real terms) despite severe drought and reduced growth in gross domestic product (GDP). Recent industrial-policy reforms are clearly paying off, as those subsectors experiencing the most rapid growth, such as telecommunications, computers, and electronics, have also been the targets of specific reforms. The telecommunications industry, for example, has responded to the opening up of telecommunication-equipment manufacturing to the private sector, while the electronics and computer industries have benefited from a liberalization of imports. Licensing requirements have been eased, and the scope of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act has been reduced."
1988,"Growth in India's manufactured exports has responded to several factors, including a new trade and payments policy, which has provided quicker and more generous incentives to exporters, import liberalization, and a dramatic appreciation of European and Asian currencies against the Indian rupee. The rapid expansion of exports made it possible for India to reduce its current-account deficit and maintain adequate levels of foreign-exchange reserves despite the upward pressure on imports caused by the drought."
1988,"Indonesia's continuing reforms in the trade and industrial-policy regime also have helped spur export performance. Nonoil export earnings reached an estimated $9.4 billion in fiscal 1988, an increase of 40 percent in nominal terms and 24 percent in real terms over the previous year.7 While several commodity exports, such as palm oil and shrimp, recorded sizable increases, 65 percent of the increase was due to manufactured exports, which grew by 40 percent in real terms."
1988,"The Bank is supporting further trade reforms, which were launched in 1987 in all three countries. Nepal is liberalizing its import-licensing system; Bangladesh and Nepal will eliminate quantitative restrictions on imports in favor of appropriate tariffs; Sri Lanka and Bangladesh will reduce the level of protection through a decline in nominal tariff levels; and all three will introduce or extend export incentives."
1988,"The government has taken significant steps toward the greater commercialization of housing through rent increases for public housing and the establishment of a housing bank to provide mortgage finance for housing construction and purchases. In the financial sector, the policy emphasis has focused on the institutional strengthening of existing financial-sector institutions, as well as the establishment of new financial-sector intermediaries, newly licensed investment companies, and the emergence of new financial instruments such as bonds and quasi-equity securities. Reforms were also introduced in the trade-and-payments regime, permitting certain joint-venture enterprises to trade foreign exchange. In the agricultural sector, a Bank rural sector-adjustment operation is supporting the launching of a second phase of reforms. The proj-"
1988,"Since the early 1980s, the external environment faced by Indonesia has worsened considerably. Real oil prices have fallen by more than 50 percent, with most of the decline occurring since early 1986. At the same time, Indonesia's external-debt burden rose sharply because of the depreciation of the United States dollar since mid 1985. In response, the government has taken decisive action to restrain domestic demand, mobilize additional resources, and set in train the structural changes needed to develop the nonoil economy. The government's adjustment effort, which was intensified in response to the external shocks of 1986, has had three key elements: the restraint of domestic demand through austere fiscal and monetary policies; the devaluation of the rupiah in late 1986 and flexible exchange-rate management throughout 1987; and continuing reforms in the trade and industrial-policy areas. This strong growth-oriented adjustment effort has succeeded in reducing external and domestic imbalances, while also sustaining a satisfactory rate of economic growth and stimulating a strong performance in nonoil exports."
1988,"Bank lending to Indonesia in fiscal 1988 supported the government's adjustment efforts through a second trade-policy adjustment loan and through operations in transport, energy, irrigation, and urban development, each designed to improve overall sectoral efficiency and effectiveness. The government's concern for the sustainability of natural-resource use was supported through a forestry conservation and uplands watershed-protection project, and through a major study of environmental issues on Java and in the Outer Islands. The forestry project will help design better forest-management techniques in commercially viable areas, while putting in place more effective measures to protect five conservation areas from encroachment. An important start was also made in the reform of the government's accounting and auditing system through an accountancy-development project."
1988,"on agricultural growth has yet to be fully assessed, it is clear that Tunisia has been particularly adversely affected. Growth in 1987, however, picked up in Tunisia to 5.8 percent after a year of retrenchment that resulted from the effects of severe drought and a sharp terms-of-trade deterioration caused by the collapse of oil prices. Exports, responding to a 17 percent real depreciation of the dinar in 1986, increased by slightly more than 12 percent per capita. Consumption, however, dropped for the third consecutive year. Tunisia's overall performance was mirrored, in certain respects, in Egypt, where the GNP grew by close to 4 percent without a rise in per capita consumption. Following a de facto devaluation of about 10 percent in the Egyptian pound, exports rose by 11 percent. Imports increased, as well, following two years of restraints. In light of weak oil prices, recovery was weaker in Algeria: GNP grew by less than 2 percent after falling in 1986. Consumption, investments, and imports all decreased, while the growth of exports was moderate."
1988,"Reductions in the fiscal deficits in ways that are compatible both with growth and a return to external creditworthiness appear, at this time, to be the major challenges for the middle-income countries of the region. However, commitment to growth has continued to provide incentives for the pursuit of adjustment policies, and many countries initiated or continued economic-adjustment programs during the year. Reform programs included those for the financial sector (Algeria, Hungary, Turkey, and Yugoslavia), public-sector restructuring (Poland and Tunisia), pricing (Hungary, Turkey, and Yugoslavia, and very likely in Algeria), taxation (Hungary, Morocco, and Tunisia), and trade liberalization (Poland, Tunisia, and Yugoslavia)."
1988,"It is expected that, at least in the short term, any increase in oil revenues of these countries is likely to be limited and that restraint in government expenditure will continue to be exercised. At the same time, there is an increasing call for the private sector to increase its contribution to the growth process, making use of the massive infrastructure in place and applying profits accumulated during the boom years in productive investments in the context of specific incentive schemes. It remains to be seen to what extent the private sector in the various countries will rise to this challenge in the face of limited opportunities for diversification and trade barriers in international markets, particularly against petrochemicals, for which these countries have a comparative advantage."
1988,"The reduction in the availability of external finance, the deterioration in the terms of trade, and the rise in interest rates encountered by the developing countries during the early to mid 1980s required an improvement in the current account of their balance of payments. Almost all countries of the region improved their current account, and many countries achieved surpluses in their nonin-terest current account of the balance of payments. Nevertheless, the current accounts for most countries in the region are still in deficit, indicating that the region continues to finance part of the servicing of its foreign debt from external sources."
1988,savings to accommodate both a decline in net borrowing and an increased level of debt service; increases in public-sector savings (since most debt is owed by governments); and a shift of resources to tradeables.
1988,"While countries of the region have had considerable success in shifting resources to tradeables, the problem of mobilizing incremental savings for, or by, the public sector has proved far more difficult. Beginning in the early 1980s, most borrowers ran substantial budget deficits. To implement needed adjustment without reducing investment or increasing inflation would have required some combination of reduction in the noninterest public-sector deficits and increases in private savings. Reducing public-sector deficits posed a serious dilemma, however, since the public sector needed to increase spending to service debt. Payments of interest in domestic currency were increased further by the devaluations undertaken to help accomplish balance-of-payments adjustment. However, the capacity to reduce current expenditures was limited, both by the need to maintain essential services and a reluctance to cut back ongoing programs to existing beneficiaries; and the capacity to raise revenues in the short term was limited by an inability to broaden tax bases and institutional weakness in revenue collection. Although in some countries the budget deficit increased after the initial external shocks, it tended to decline in a number of countries that instituted stabilization and reform programs. Deficits have again widened recently, however, in Turkey and Pakistan, and are still large in Egypt."
1988,"In this environment of difficult external and domestic economic conditions, the World Bank continued to provide assistance for adjustment efforts—both at the macroeconomic and sectoral levels—aimed at strengthening the capacity of countries to implement reforms in the industry, energy, trade, agriculture, and financial sectors. With a first structural-adjustment loan in Tunisia and several sector-adjustment loans in three countries (Hungary, Morocco, and Turkey), policy-based lending reached a new high for the region, with amounts totaling $1,005.1 million, or about 30 percent of total lending for the year. Turkey remained the region's largest borrower from the Bank, with $1,064 million in loan commitments"
1988,"The price-stabilization programs of Argentina (the Austral Plan of June 1985) and Brazil (the Cruzado Plan of February 1986) were effective initially in controlling inflation and accelerating recovery of output. The Austral Plan can be judged to have been a qualified success, but because of various circumstances, inflationary pressures eventually reappeared and trade surpluses diminished. Economic performance since late 1986 in both countries has been largely determined by new efforts to control inflationary pressures and emerging external imbalances. Difficulties in reconciling a viable balance-of-payments position with the control of inflation, as well as the reduction of public-sector deficits affected by the burden imposed by debt service and other internal imbalances, have increased the cost of adjustment programs, as reflected in the reduction of per capita consumption levels and a general slowdown in economic growth. In many countries, as in Argentina, projections demonstrate the continued fragility of the external-financing situation and the vulnerability of the economy to the international economic environment."
1988,"Brazil's trade surplus has already regained recent high levels, but deceleration of per capita GDP growth has been significant, and inflation is higher than before the inauguration of the Cruzado Plan. Bolivia managed to stop its hyperinflation through radical fiscal and monetary measures, but has continued to suffer large imbalances on external accounts and had only a small rise in GDP in 1987 after six consecutive years of decline."
1988,"adjustments were reflected in further declines in GDP per capita during 1987 in Mexico, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Trinidad and Tobago. Although output began to recover in Mexico, the pace of recovery may slow because of the adoption of austerity measures to control inflation. Increasing exports of Mexican manufactures led the recovery of output, and strong export performance brought about a large trade surplus. In Venezuela, a partial program of corrective measures was initiated in December 1986. However, the rate of growth of output remained slow, and inflation reached record levels."
1988,"slowly recovering for more than two years. Per capita GDP is still well below the precrisis levels in these countries. Trade deficits exist in all the Central American countries, and reduced levels of foreign aid have been offset mainly by increases in arrears and further losses in reserves. Inflation remained variable but low, except in Nicaragua, where it has been extraordinarily high."
1988,"increased international interest rates and worsened terms of trade. Debt-restructuring agreements facilitated adjustment of debt-service payments to ability to pay. Multilateral official lenders provided additional financing. Debtor countries drastically reduced domestic absorption, in particular, investment and imports. Thus, the external adjustment was accompanied by a sharp reduction in growth, and, in some cases, a decline in output."
1988,"Results have been mixed. In Chile and Uruguay, for instance, recovery of growth has taken place through implementation, at an early stage, of adjustment policies. Mexico is currently undergoing in-depth adjustment, although growth is being constrained by the strong stabilization measures that have been adopted to lower inflation. In a number of countries, however, adjustment efforts have not met expectations. The reasons are several: lower growth of the world economy, insufficient external resources to support adjustment efforts, and failure by some debtor countries to undertake economic reform. In addition, several countries have been affected by adverse terms of trade."
1988,"The medium-term package contained a significant menu of options, providing the commercial banks with different incentives to participate. The new-money facilities in the package total $5.2 billion to help Brazil cover its financing needs for 1987, 1988, and the first half of 1989. The package also included a multiyear restructuring agreement covering approximately $61 billion of Brazil's medium-term and long-term debt to commercial banks, as well as trade and interbank facilities, totaling about $15 billion, under which commercial banks will continue to extend short-term trade and interbank lines."
1988,"An increasing proportion, about 40 percent, of Bank commitments were in the form of adjustment lending in six countries to support economic policy reforms aimed at promoting stabilization, overcoming structural constraints, and strengthening institutions. Mexico and Argentina were the largest recipients, followed by Colombia. Adjustment lending supported policy reforms in the trade, fertilizer, and agricultural sectors in Mexico; the banking sector in Argentina; and the power sector in Colombia. The third in a series of broader structural-adjustment loans was made in Chile. Other adjustment lending supported reforms in the financial sectors in Bolivia and Ecuador. Adjustment lending, linked to policy progress, will continue to"
1988,"The Bank carried out a strong economic policy dialogue with its Latin American and Caribbean borrowers with increased staff resources in fiscal 1988. This dialogue covers stabilization and debt-management issues, as well as medium-term to longer-term constraints to growth with a focus on the detail of needed policy reforms and issues of transition. Continuing themes have been on improving the efficiency of the public sector—particularly with regard to investment planning, taxation, and public enterprises—trade policies, and domestic regulation. Work on the environment, poverty, and the social costs of adjustment is being deepened. Improved targetting in the social sectors has also received increased attention."

1963,"In the year just past, the amount of Bank and IDA lending for agricultural projects, while not large, compared favorably with that of previous years, and included a variety of unusual undertakings: The Bank made a loan in the Republic of China for the purchase of fishing vessels, and lent in Chile for the improvement of pastureland and the acquisition of breeding stock. IDA lent for livestock production in Paraguay and to strengthen an agricultural credit institution in Jordan. The Bank and IDA are hopeful that their assistance to agricultural credit institutions can be extended; these institutions should become progressively more important channels for other international sources of funds as well, and can serve as focal points for a wide range of domestic measures to raise agricultural production. By combining technical advice and supervision with the provision of finance, they can often greatly enhance the effectiveness of both."
1963,"The first two groups of appointees under the Junior Professional Recruitment Program entered the Bank during the fiscal year, and the third group was appointed. This program brings young university graduates of outstanding ability into the career staff through a two-year period of in-service training, upon completion of which it is expected that they will be given regular staff assignments. The 33 appointees average 28 years of age, ranging from 24 to 31, and come from 20 countries: Argentina, Austria, Belgium, China, Colombia, Cuba, France, Germany, Greece, India, Italy, Japan, Norway, Philippines, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States."
1963,"The Bank agreed to organize and help finance a study of transportation in Northern Rhodesia. As Administrator of the Indus Basin Development Fund, the Bank organized a study of the water and power resources of West Pakistan, to be financed by the Fund. Studies were continued of problems of coal transport in India, of electric power development in Ecuador, and of school design and construction methods in Tunisia. The Bank provided technical assistance to the Iranian Electricity Authority. Studies were completed of the transport needs of the Republic of China and of Ecuador, as were studies of the development of secondary roads in Northern Nigeria and of water and sewerage for the Manila area of the Philippines. Field work was completed in connection with a proposed new crossing on the Hooghly River in Calcutta, India.

It is estimated that a total of $9.4 million will be invested in the project. Population pressure on Taiwan's limited arable land has brought about an acceleration in the development of the fishing industry in the last 10 years. As a result, the fishing fleet has grown to some 5,800 powered vessels, the annual catch has increased to well over 300,000 metric tons, and the industry employs about 300,000 people, providing support for over twice that number."

1963,AN EVENT OF OUTSTANDING SIGNIFICANCE for the international development effort was the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in the spring of 1964. In twelve weeks of deliberations it ranged over the whole panorama of issues relating both to international trade and to the financing of economic development.
1963,"The President of the World Bank group addressed the Conference, and the Bank and IDA were represented throughout the proceedings. The President transmitted to the Conference a report on ""Trade, Development and the World Bank Group""; and two Bank staff studies— ""Economic Growth and External Debt"" and ""The Commodity Problem""—were prepared for"
1963,"THE BANK CONTINUED during the year its studies of the prospects for the principal commodities moving in world trade, which are so crucial to the investment and growth potential of the less developed countries. It made available to the International Cotton Advisory Committee a study of prospects for extra-long staple cotton. In addition, at the initiative of the International Coffee Council, the Bank agreed to take part with the Council and the Food and Agriculture Organization in a long-range study of the coffee problem, directed in part to seeking alternative production and investment opportunities for the countries concerned."
1963,"Niger, a landlocked country, has to rely on the transport systems and ports of neighboring Nigeria and Dahomey for its foreign trade. Because of the long distances to ports—over 800 miles—the high transport costs of Niger's overseas trade has a detrimental effect on the economy."
1963,"The road system in Tanganyika is of primary-importance, since the railways serve only parts of the country and the population, widely dispersed over a large area, requires an extensive transportation network. There are some 10,000 miles of main roads which serve as trunk routes between provincial centers and with neighboring countries. Their quality, however, is very uneven, with paved sections near the towns and long stretches between towns with only earth surfacing. The project being assisted by the IDA credit is a step toward the construction of an interconnected all-weather highway system. It consists of the construction or improvement of eight main roads in various parts of the country, totaling 734 miles. All the roads are important to production and trade, as they serve areas now producing cash crops or with a potential for agriculture."
1963,"foreign trade and serves an area containing more than half Tunisia's population of four million. The volume of traffic, nearly 2.4 million tons a year, is beyond the capacity of the port to handle efficiently, and is expected to increase by a quarter in the next decade. Most of the general cargo is now handled at the old port of Tunis at the landward end of a six-mile canal across the Lake of Tunis. Since there is no room for expansion at Tunis and the approach is difficult, the Government intends to transfer port operations progressively to the new port of La Goulette at the seaward end of the canal, where conditions are more favorable."

Co-financing from the People's Republic of China and Iran has been agreed upon. Additional funds are expected to be forthcoming from other sources, including the Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau. Total cost: $386 million."
1977,"During their latest review of program lending, conducted in April 1977, the Executive Directors considered four types of ""special circumstances"" for such lending: (a) reconstruction or rehabilitation of the economy after war or severe national calamity, where an expeditious transfer of external resources is needed to restore the process of normal development activity; (b) the need to supply industrial raw materials or equipment to raise the use of existing industrial capacity; (c) a sudden fall in export earnings, where the economy is critically dependent on a single export item; and (d) a sharp deterioration in the terms of trade as a result of a rapid rise in import prices."
1977,"In the long run, the Bank believes, it is important to create or strengthen agencies in developing countries that can inform industrial entrepreneurs and financial institutions about the technological alternatives available for production and product design, and that can develop and adapt such technology domestically. Trade associations, institutions of technology, universities, and productivity centers can all play a part—as can Bank assistance, where such institutions are inadequate."
1977,"The economic events of the mid-1970s affected higher-income developing countries in ways different from the poorest. Because most depend more heavily than the poorest on oil imports and on international trade, they were acutely affected by higher petroleum prices and the worldwide recession. Most of the countries in this group adjusted to the new economic situation quickly, however; many made necessary internal adjustments in their fiscal, monetary, or price policies; most were able to borrow heavily from private sources to maintain their investment, and thus they avoided too sharp a decline in growth rates."
1977,"The process of adjustment to the new situation brought about by the unfavorable terms of trade has been marked, in some cases, by austerity programs and a basic restructuring of investment, as in Kenya and Tanzania. Some programs have been accompanied by courageous measures to stimulate agricultural production and restrain real urban incomes. Some of tke more ambitious targets to provide social infrastructure to the masses of the people had to be postponed in favor of more directly productive activities. These measures have met with some degree of success, but where the resource shortfall was very large and short-term indebtedness increased rapidly (as in Zaire), the reduced import capacity retarded the successful recovery in the production of goods and services. Also, new initiatives for production, particularly in agriculture, depend, firstly, on a proper administrative framework which, very often, is in urgent need of strengthening."
1977,"Countries less affected by the movements in the terms of trade, or having benefited from inflationary movements in world commodity markets (Mauritius and Swaziland) have continued to show satisfactory rates of growth. Growth rates have also been satisfactory in Sudan, where major expansion in agricultural investment is beginning to show results. And the economies of some of the smaller countries, like Lesotho and Malawi, have shown a resiliency characteristic of a primarily agricultural thrust of development. Finally, countries of extreme poverty such as Burundi, Ethiopia, and Rwanda have experienced lesser setbacks as they are less vulnerable due to a slower pace of growth; in 197677, they benefited from the increase in the price of coffee. As time goes by, and crises of various magnitudes are overcome, the need for institutional improvements more and more clearly becomes the most pervasive factor of development in almost all the countries of the Region; institution building and development of cadres to operate new administrative and service structures, particularly in the field of agriculture, are the most urgent tasks facing governments."

1977,"The East African Community (EAC), composed of Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, and based on the Treaty of 1967, was both directly and indirectly affected by the severe balance of payments and financial pressures of recent years. Directly, common market trade was impaired as a result of restrictions in national imports and foreign exchange. Indirectly, fiscal austerity exacerbated existing tensions and mutual suspicions over the distribution of benefits from the Community Corporations, which had been reinforced by widening differences of political philosophy between the Partner States. The financial problems of the Corporations seriously affected their ability to meet external debt obligations and led to some delays in service payments. But since the agreement in May 1976 between the Partner States on the sharing of debt service and payments procedures, debt service to the World Bank has been met regularly."
1977,"""•most of the Region's exports. The landlocked Sahelian countries benefited from substantially higher world prices for cotton and groundnuts, and Niger benefited to an even greater extent from the second doubling of uranium prices in less than three years. Several coastal countries, notably Cameroon, Ghana, Ivory Coast, and Nigeria, enjoyed booming coffee and/or cocoa prices and were further aided by the recovery in the prices for timber. Senegal and Togo, on the other hand, suffered from the sharp setback in the prices for phosphate rock; this development, however, was at least partly offset by rather more favorable earnings from agricultural exports. Generally, export volumes tended to pick up as well, reflecting the end of the economic recession in the industrialized nations, so that even the countries—Mauritania, Liberia, and Guinea—relying on exports of iron ore and bauxite, whose prices remained more or less stagnant, experienced some improvement over the preceding year. At the same time, increases in the prices of imports moderated, reversing the previous deterioration in the terms of trade for most West African countries."
1977,"The Bank is providing technical assistance in setting up the Fund's organization and operating procedures. It has also seconded advisers to other regional groupings, including the Banque Ouest Africaine de Developpement, set up within the six-member Union Monetaire Ouest Africaine.(2> In addition, a West African Clearing House was launched to facilitate payments among West African states. Headquartered in Freetown, Sierra Leone, the Clearing House will handle direct payments between its seven members' central banks'3' and promote the use of local currency in intra-regional trading. It is, therefore, expected to spur intra-West African trade and allied transactions."
1977,"during the recent years of sharp price fluctuations in international trade and worldwide recession. Specific circumstances in a number of countries are discussed elsewhere in this chapter but, generally, the Region's economies continued to grow significantly in this difficult period. However, with worsening terms of trade and a slowing down, or even stagnation, in real exports, deficits in the current account balance of payments increased greatly in 1974 and/or 1975, and some countries suffered substantial losses in international reserves notwithstanding increased foreign borrowing. In 1976, with renewed growth in the international economy, real exports of all the countries in the Region recovered rapidly, and grew faster than imports. In a majority of the countries, the international terms of trade also improved, current balance of payments deficits were reduced sharply, and international reserves replenished. Although, in some countries, the terms of trade continued to deteriorate, even these current account deficits stabilized, and no loss of reserves occurred. Overall, therefore, the past year was favorable for the Region, with a continuation of recovery in economic growth in all countries, and a sharply improved balance of payments position in most of them. In addition, inflation, a grave problem for all countries during the international stagflation of 1974-75, continued to abate."
1977,"The Philippines and Thailand suffered from a less favorable export mix, and their terms of trade, therefore, continued to deteriorate in 1976.

Nevertheless, large current account deficits per-"
1977,"The remaining major World Bank borrower in the Region, the Republic of Korea, which largely depends on industrial exports, was hard hit by the sharp increases in the prices of petro-4eum, foodgrains, and other imports, and by the international recession. Consequently, it ran substantial current account deficits in both 1974 and 1975. With the recovery in the world econ-*omy in 1976, Korea's exports increased by about 45% in volume, and its terms of trade also improved greatly. As a result, the current account deficit declined to about $300 million, and net reserves recovered substantially, while the GNP growth rate, which had averaged 8% per annum, even during the difficult years of 1974 and 1975, rose sharply to 15%."

1977,"""Early in calendar 1977, best estimates were that real gross domestic product (GDP) might rise around 2% on top of the 8.8% growth for 1976. Lower GDP growth in 1977 may be explained by the fact that agricultural production, although the second highest on record, was less than in 1976—a year of exceptionally favorable monsoons. Production of cash crops generally increased, however. Industrial production was also projected to grow—by more than 10%, or twice the increase of 1976, and the highest in more than a decade—as a result of increasing domestic and export demand and generally adequate supplies of power. The country's trade balance also headed for a major improvement in 1977. Exports of manufactures increased considerably, and the total volume of exports was likely to grow about 10%, reflecting the effect of policies of stimulation implemented last year. As a result, foreign exchange earnings were estimated to increase about 16%. With total imports declining somewhat (led by declines in imports of fertilizer, fuel, and foodgrains), the country's trade deficit is likely to be about $1,000 million lower than the fiscal 1976 deficit of $1,500 million. In addition, the net receipt of invisibles is expected to rise by some $300 million, resulting in a balance of payments surplus and an addition to foreign exchange reserves. Though inflation is of some concern again (wholesale prices, which fell steadily between September 1974 and March 1976, in subsequent months were rising at an annual rate of about 10%), the large foodgrain stock, as well as the increased scope for imports resulting from large foreign exchange reserves «and further liberalization, should help counter further upward pressure on prices."
1977,"In fiscal 1976, Nepal's economic situation improved markedly, led by a substantial increase in foodgrain and cash crop production. That improvement continued into 1977. Production of various manufactured goods also increased. Growth in exports was not as rapid in fiscal 1977 as in the previous year, however, and Nepal's trade balance in fiscal 1977 may not be as favorable as in the 12 previous months."
1977,"The Third Education Project, for which the Bank provided $48.5 million in assistance, will help meet the need for middle-level technicians and skilled workers through the development of a network of job-oriented technical high schools of a new type and the construction of two vocational training centers. (In addition, by supporting the systematic decentralization of places of training, the project may help reduce regional inequalities and also foster the development of local industries.) Fifteen technical high schools will be built (out of a planned 30), which will offer three-year courses in mechanics, electricity, electronics, building construction, industrial chemistry, and commerce. In the vocational centers, workers in various specializations for some 15 different industrial and building construction trades will be trained as skilled craftsmen."
1977,"The export earnings of a number of countries in the area benefited from the resurgence of commodity prices during the past year. In addition to the doubling of coffee prices, gains were also recorded in soybeans, fish meal, cotton, wool, copper, and other nonferrous metals. Meat prices recovered only mildly, however, and sugar prices plummeted in world markets. Price declines were also registered for certain cereals, mainly exported by Argentina. In the case of manufactured exports, the past year brought some improvement, though only moderate. The recovery of demand in the industrial countries, accompanied by flexible exchange rate policies in the exporting countries, led to a resurgence in the growth of manufactured exports in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico; in real terms, however, growth is still below that achieved in 1974. As import prices increased relatively slowly in 1976, the terms of trade of most Latin American and Caribbean countries recovered substantially during the year."

The importance of agricultural price and subsidy policy has been underlined by the existence of a shorter-range project in which a number of country case studies are being undertaken. Among the projects with a bearing on rural development, an inquiry into the effects of technological innovation in agriculture represents a new departure; an attempt is being made to identify the factors influencing the pace and the way in which new technology is absorbed and the policy measures that might affect these factors."
1977,"Formal consultations were held during the year with the Japanese aid agencies (the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan and the Export-Import Bank of Japan), the Commonwealth Development Corporation, the United Kingdom Ministry of Overseas Development, and the French Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation, to review questions of common interest and to discuss country and project matters. Regular contacts were maintained with the Abu Dhabi Fund for Arab Economic Development, the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, BADEA, the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, the Islamic Development Bank, the Saudi Fund for Development, and the Venezuelan Investment Fund, as well as financing agencies in the OECD countries, to determine possibilities for co-financing of specific projects. In addition, discussions took place with representatives of the newly organized OPEC Special Fund and the International Fund for Agricultural Development to explore avenues for cooperation between the Bank and those organizations."
1977,"The Bank prepared substantive material for, and was represented at, the UN World Water Conference in Argentina, and attended the Conference on the Law of the Sea, contributing to the Annotated Directory of Intergovernmental Organizations Concerned with Ocean Affairs.

1976,"Before the first loans on Third Window terms were approved, eligibility criteria for beneficiaries of Third Window loans were established by the Bank. It was agreed that Third Window lending would be normally (but not exclusively) extended to countries with 1972 per capita incomes of under $375; that loans would be extended only to countries which were regarded as making reasonable development efforts in relation to their resource base and development potential; and that potential recipient countries must be judged able to repay the loans, taking account of the deterioration in their terms of trade and other factors affecting their long-run capacity to repay loans in foreign exchange."

Where the increase in debt in current dollars is compared with other relevant magnitudes, for example, changes in imports or exports, the increase, while large, is a good deal less alarming. Although the account of these increases which follows is in terms of groups of countries, the incidence of external debt and debt service on borrowers is carefully examined on a country-by-country basis in the Bank's continuing work. To some extent, debt service on debt incurred in earlier years (which does not change when prices increase) is less costly to the debtor if exports command higher prices. This is revealed by the very modest increases or declines in the ratio of service payments to exports in 1974 for very many countries/10' The recession of 1974-75 and declining terms of trade aggravated the deterioration as it made imports more costly in terms of exports, and imposed difficult adjustments on borrowers in 1975. These difficulties are only beginning to be mitigated somewhat by the upturn in economic activity in some industrialized countries in 1975 and during the first months of 1976."
1976,"both rural and urban poverty. But there is substantial evidence indicating that modern large-scale enterprise will not provide employment opportunities for more than a small fraction of the growing labor force. Thus, growth in incomes of a large part of the nonfarm work force will depend on growth of earnings opportunities in the small-scale industrial, construction, trade, transport, and other service industries."
1976,"In countries showing little improvement, or even a further deterioration in their terms of trade (Tanzania, Zaire, and Zambia), per capita real incomes declined for the second year in a"
1976,"Developments in the region during fiscal 1976 were marked by generally good harvests on the one hand and sharp deteriorations in terms of trade on the other. The latter development, together with a slow growth in ex-'ports, eroded the region's capacity to import, reduced public revenues and savings and, with the major exception of Nigeria, cut down investments in real terms."
1976,"While costs rose, the capacity of many governments to contribute domestic resources to investment finance—though there were substantial differences among them—was eroded. Good harvests reduced food import requirements in the poorer, landlocked countries. But, at the same time, there was little scope to raise government revenues (which depend mainly on foreign trade), as the prices of their principal agricultural exports, groundnuts and cotton, began to decline. In the better off and more diversified agricultural coastal countries, the output of cash crops expanded and export prices were somewhat better, especially for coffee. Prices of cocoa and timber, on the other hand, were lower than last year, and the servicing of debts on public borrowing from private sources began to claim a higher share of available revenues. The revenue positions of the Western African mineral producers were, on the whole, much stronger than in the early 1970s, but prices for bauxite and phosphate weakened during 1975, and production in some countries, including the petroleum producers, was less than had been expected at the beginning of the year."
1976,"The past year was again a difficult one for most countries in the East Asia and Pacific region. Nonetheless, their economic prospects at the end of the year were not as gloomy as they had been 12 months earlier. The economic difficulties which began in 1974 persisted, but in less acute form. Among those difficulties, especially pronounced was the deterioration in the terms of trade which, for most countries in the region, started during 1974; the full impact of the deterioration was felt through the whole of 1975."
1976,"The combination of a slackening demand for the region's exports (due to the international recession), and a worsening in the terms of trade, led to an abrupt rise in current account balance of payments deficits for the larger countries in 1975. The exception was the Republic of Korea, where the terms of trade deterioration had occurred early and had already led to a deficit of $2,000 million in 1974. This was reduced slightly in 1975."
1976,"sharp drop in the prices of its other major commodity exports, and a rapid increase in imports of investment goods. Thailand's balance of payments changed from rough balance in 1974 to a current account deficit of about $550 million in 1975, as the country's volume of exports remained unchanged and its terms of trade deteriorated by 10% compared with 1974."
1976,"The Philippines experienced a fourfold increase in its current account deficit, from $207 million in 1974 to $860 million in 1975, as the prices of most of its major exports (sugar, copper, and copra) fell drastically. The high prices of the Philippines' commodity exports had earlier cushioned the effect of the substantial rise in the prices of petroleum and other imports. Thus, in 1974, the Philippines' terms of trade actually improved by nearly 12%, but, a year later, they deteriorated by an unprecedented 33%."
1976,"Despite the relatively favorable trends in agricultural production, incomes and employment for the mass of the people tended to deteriorate during 1975. This deterioration was due to some slackening in economic activity and unfavorable price movements. Adjusted for changes in the terms of trade, per capita real in* comes failed to grow in most countries. Though a large part of the impact of the worsening terms of trade was borne by the rural population (which earned less even though agricultural output increased), it was the urban population which suffered most because of rising unemployment. The loss in agricultural incomes through deteriorating terms of trade partially offset gains made during the earlier commodity boom, and agricultural terms of trade during 1975 often were only marginally, if at all, better than in 1972."
1976,"Larger food supplies, together with strong financial stabilization efforts initiated by most governments, were effective in stopping or slowing inflation for the first time in several years. Increased foreign financial support to the region from both multilateral and bilateral sources, including OPEC (Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries) funds for some countries in the region, also helped efforts to tackle terms of trade problems."
1976,"themselves to conserve energy and to use substitute fuels, such as coal for oil, also helped to soften the impact of adverse terms of trade."
1976,"The improved economic conditions of the past year should not, however, obscure the fundamental development problems of the region. Nor should they be allowed to distract attention from world price changes, which aggravated investment problems by causing large deficits and by increasing the already heavy debt burden in the region. (The effects of the price changes can be measured by the sudden and marked increase in the region's aggregate trade deficit in fiscal 1975 to some $4,500 million, a fivefold increase over fiscal 1973.)"
1976,"India's foodgrain harvest, thanks to favorable weather conditions, reached an estimated 116 million tons, 7% above the record reached in fiscal 1971. This was a welcome change from the years since 1973, which had been among the most difficult the country had faced since independence. They were plagued with a succession of poor crops, a dramatic, adverse shift in the terms of trade, and inflation. The bumper foodgrain harvest in the year created some stress on the available foodgrain storage facilities in India. (The problem also exists in Bangladesh and, to a lesser degree, Pakistan and Burma.)"
1976,"Pakistan has succeeded in maintaining a rising trend of real investment, in spite of adverse terms of trade and balance of payments problems, and domestic resource constraints, which reflect a marked decline in the rate of saving. Fixed investment increased by 20% in real terms in fiscal 1975 and may have increased by 18% in fiscal 1976. Much of the increase is taking place in the public sector, but private investment is also expected to rise with the Government's clarification of its position on compensation to be paid to nationalized industries and assurances that no further nationalization is being planned. Growth in investment in the past two years has been made possible"
1976,"The terms of trade effects and the amount of reserves accumulated have naturally differed among countries. Though Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates had capital surpluses, some of them are now resorting to external borrowings. The Maghreb countries — Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia—as well as Oman, continued to have substantial external borrowing require-"
1976,"Economic recession was the proximate cause for the severe restrictions placed by the labor-importing countries of the European Communities on the employment of migrant workers. The restrictions reduced the prospective growth of workers' remittances, an important component of the total foreign exchange earnings of such countries as Greece, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, and Yugoslavia. (All five countries also experienced significant deteriorations in their terms of trade.) The closing off of the ""safety valve"" of migration is adding, in these countries, and others, similarly situated (Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia), impetus to their ongoing efforts to create additional jobs, initially through rapid industrialization."
1976,"The economic growth of the countries of the Latin America and the Caribbean region slowed considerably during the fiscal year, as increases in exports and output were much smaller than in the previous three years. In some countries, exports and output actually declined. The recession in the industrial countries of Europe and North America was the main cause of economic deceleration in the region. Declining demand in the industrial countries reduced growth of export volumes, and caused the prices of several important agricultural commodities—beef, sugar, soybeans, and cotton— to decline. Mineral prices also fell sharply, led by copper, which dropped 40%. While in nominal (current dollar) terms, export prices were not, on average, below their 1973 levels, the continued rise in import prices caused a further deterioration in the terms of trade in"
1976,"calendar 1975 following that in 1974. The terms of trade in 1975 were 18% below the 1973-74 average for Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Peru, taken as a group."
1976,"development of the region, the adjustments to the new environment also brought out the strength and resiliency of several economies. A number of countries managed to avoid even sharper falls in their export earnings through effective economic and financial policies. Others benefited from increases in the prices of selected commodities and improvements in agricultural output and exports. Thus, the increase in the price of coffee in late 1975 (the frost in Brazil sharply reduced prospective supplies) and price rises in bananas were important to Central America and Colombia. The strong ""growth of regional trade, fueled, in part, by the continuing high demand for imports by Venezuela, was also a positive factor. Mexico's external position benefited from an increase in petroleum exports. In the Caribbean, marketing agreements caused the impact of higher sugar prices to be delayed until 1975, and the terms of trade for Barbados, Guyana, and Trinidad and Tobago improved for the second consecutive year."
1976,"BURUNDI: IDA—$6 million. Fish production from Lake Tanganyika will increase by about 10,000 tons and about 3,000 fishermen (half of them new to the trade) will earn between $300 and $600 yearly as a result of this project, co-financed with the help ($1 million) of a loan from the Abu Dhabi Fund. Total cost: $8.6 million."
1976,"The Bank was represented at the Fourth UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), held in Nairobi. A senior Bank staff member was seconded to the UNCTAD secretariat to assist in the preparation for the Conference. The Bank participated also in the UN Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat) in Vancouver. For Habitat, the Bank supplied documentation and three films: on traffic constraints, urban construction, and ""sites and services"" packages for housing development.

Technical assistance will also be provided to the Alexandria Port Authority. Co-financing is expected from USAID and the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan. Total cost: $151 million."
1976,"Formal consultations were held during the year with Japanese agencies (the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan and the Export-Import Bank of Japan) regarding their respective lending programs; with the Federal Republic of Germany, the Commonwealth Development Corporation, and the Development Cooperation Directorate of the EEC to review questions of common interest and to discuss country and project matters; and with the Abu Dhabi Fund for Arab Economic Development, the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, BADEA, the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, the Islamic Development Bank, and the Saudi Fund for Development to determine possibilities for cooperation on specific projects."
1976,"The Bank was involved in the preparation of, and participated in, several major conferences during the year. It has had permanent observer status in three of the commissions of the Conference for International Economic Cooperation (CIEC)—those on development, finance, and raw materials. The Bank's staff took part in the discussions and provided considerable documentation on economic prospects of developing countries, international capital flows, commodity price stabilization, energy, and problems of development financing."
1962,"During the year the Bank continued to expand its assistance to member countries in preparing development projects and programs up to the point where they are ready for financing. Seven new project or sector studies were undertaken, of widely varied character. In Ecuador the Bank is meeting the foreign exchange costs of a survey of all types of transport, and of a study to lay the basis for a national electrification program. In India, consultants are studying ways to solve the coal transport problem, both for the short and the long term. In Iran a team of experts is to advise on the establishment and operation of an Electricity Authority. In Nigeria a study is being made by consultants of highway needs in the northern part of the country. In the Republic of China, consultants are helping the Government to prepare an investment program for improvement of the transport facilities of Taiwan. In Tunisia consultants will make a study of school designs and construction methods, and design three prototype schools, to assist the Government in obtaining the best value for its investment in this sector. The direct cost to the Bank of these studies will exceed $2,750,000; the full cost, of course, rises considerably if overheads in staff time and other services are taken into account."

1962,"At the same time, however, many of the developing countries continue to face severe difficulties. Some are hard-pressed to service their external debt, many are seriously handicapped by the uncertainty of prospects for their export trade, and the rapid growth of population weighs heavily on the resources of much of the underdeveloped world."
1962,"the current situation and future prospects of the principal primary products moving in international trade. Price trends in these commodities interest the Bank because they affect the capacity of its members as borrowers and guarantors; and they are of vital significance to many of the Bank's member countries, since fractional price changes can affect the trade earnings of these countries by several times the amount of the financial assistance they may be receiving from abroad. It was a natural development from these commodity reviews that led the Bank during the fiscal year to embark upon a comprehensive study of the market for extra-long staple cotton. This study, undertaken at the request of the International Cotton Advisory Committee, should be completed in the spring of 1964. Another field of work currently being studied by Bank economists concerns the special problems of African agriculture, which will be of increasing importance in future years."

Its most important traffic is carrying refined metals, ores and concentrates from the Sierra to Callao for export and bringing back supplies to the mining companies. About half of Peru's earnings from foreign trade are derived from exports of minerals, to a large extent carried by the Central.

1962,"﻿r J ""'he past year has been one of steady progress jL in improving and expanding international assistance to economic development. The amount of new financial commitments from public sources edged upward as compared with the preceding year, and was extended partly on terms more favorable to the receiving countries. International consultation was further developed, in the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, for example, and under the auspices of the World Bank itself. New arrangements were made for financial and technical help, notable among them the special drawing facility created by the International Monetary Fund to assist member countries which experience temporary declines of income from exports—especially of primary products—due to circumstances largely beyond their control."
1989,"Fastest growing among the countries in the first group were China (at 11 percent) and India (over 8 percent); the newly industrializing economies (NIEs) of East Asia continued their strong growth, also over 8 percent as a group. It is also notable that a number of ""second-tier"" NIEs—Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand, in particular—are moving into higher-performance categories. Typically, countries that performed well were those that had strong investment growth in recent years, were able to take advantage of the global trade boom (especially in manufactures), and were not encumbered by too heavy a burden of foreign or domestic debt."
1989,"Among the low-income countries, China and India, in particular, demonstrated strong growth of output, with growth rates of 11"
1989,"percent and 8 percent, respectively.3 Toward the end of the year, fears of overheating the economy and of inflation prompted China to introduce a series of administrative, monetary, and fiscal measures to regain price stability over the medium term."
1989,"The most active borrowers from the IBRD were Mexico ($2,230 million for six projects), India ($2,136 million for ten projects), and Indonesia ($1,640 million for nine projects). In terms of commitments, IDA was most active in India ($900 million for one project), China ($515 million for five projects), and Bangladesh ($423 million for four projects). In terms of the number of credits approved, sixty-nine, or 65 percent, went to sub-Saharan Africa."

In addition, provision of fluoride-free water will enable 75,000 people suffering from skeletal fluorosis to recover, partially or fully, from the effects of the disease."
1989,"In the transportation sector, ports projects, in particular, tend to include environmental issues in project formulation. Three such port projects were approved during the year, one in Algeria and two in China. Pollution reduction caused by port activities is usually an important consideration, as is the minimization of the effects of dredging."
1989,"As part of EDI's work program in China, a two-phased case-development workshop was held, in partnership with Tsinghua University (Beijing). In September 1988, a week was spent discussing and demonstrating the use of case materials of different types and providing training in their preparation and writing. Thereafter, the participants returned to their institutions to prepare their case studies on the implementation of China's economic reform. In March 1989. a week was devoted to practicing the teaching of these cases; the practice was interspersed with lectures on case use and development. The EDI expects to publish sixteen of the case studies in Chinese and about half that number in English."
1989,"In fiscal 1989, FIAS staff worked on fourteen advisory projects, four conferences, and four research projects. Of the advisory projects, ten were completed, including five in MIGA member countries. These five projects involved making recommendations on new approaches to the problem of foreign-exchange allocation to joint ventures in China; assistance in formulating a new foreign-investment code in Togo; identifying policy impediments to foreign investment in the agricultural sector in Indonesia and Senegal; and a general diagnosis of policy issues for foreign investment in Madagascar."
1989,Reform Challenges in India and China
1989,"The two largest economies in Asia, China and India, are undertaking distinctive programs of structural reform, and both have enjoyed positive growth outcomes. But over the past year, these two countries have also experienced significant macroeconomic imbalances."
1989,"In China, structural reforms have accomplished a great deal in moving the economy towards market responsiveness, but the most difficult part of the reform process lies ahead. The stunning economic results of promoting private enterprise in agriculture and decentralizing decisionmaking to urban enterprises have brought with them more fundamental problems relating to the management of investment in an economy based on public ownership of capital. Nonetheless, China's economy has advanced with remarkable speed in recent years."
1989,"China's GDP growth rates have accelerated from 7.9 percent in 1986 to 11.2 percent in 1988. Industry, which expanded by 18 percent in 1988, has provided much of the impetus. Agricultural output, by comparison, grew only by 3.5 percent. While the rising tempo of economic activity has raised the living standards of the broad mass of the population and"
1989,"served to keep alive grassroots support for China's reform program, such high rates of growth have clearly pushed the economy to the limits of its productive capacity. With investment as a percentage of GDP approaching 40 percent in 1988 and consumption demand rising by over 10 percent in real terms, shortages of energy, building materials, basic metals, and certain foodstuffs have become steadily more acute and resulted in spiraling prices. The annual increase in the retail price index tripled between 1986 and 1988, from 6.0 percent to 18.5 percent."
1989,"The Bank's operational activity in China and India continued to be substantial in fiscal 1989: India received IBRD and IDA support for eleven projects, with an emphasis on hydro-power, agriculture, and transport. The Nathpa Jhakri hydroelectric project merits special attention as a high-return, environmentally sound power project with an innovative approach to utility pricing. An export-development credit is addressing outstanding policy issues, while operations in health and family planning and education are aimed at social problems."
1989,"For China during the past year, the Bank completed work on two major economic reports. A country economic memorandum analyzed the sources of the current inflation problems and their implications for the reform process, and a tax report examined options for fiscal reform and the greater use of taxes as incentives for production and growth."
1989,"The Bank's lending program to China continued to address both growth and social sectors. Two more provincial agriculture projects aim at improving rural productivity and expanding food production. An industry project in Tianjin is supporting efforts to restructure key industries, while an operation with the China Investment Bank supports further efforts to modernize medium-sized state enterprises. Two ports projects, two provincial highways projects, and a railway project in Inner Mongolia will help address important transport bottlenecks. A textbook-development project will increase the volume and improve the quality of textbooks at all levels of education, and a health project in three regions will help find new, more cost-effective approaches to medical care and give increased emphasis to preventive medicine."
1989,"An estimated 70 million people live in conditions of absolute poverty in China, where regional disparities in natural-resource endowment and remoteness from dynamic centers of industrial and agricultural development add a distinct geographical dimension to the incidence of poverty. The Bank is helping the government in alleviating poverty in remote areas through rural-development projects in Nei Monggol and Ningxia (where 123,000 families are expected to increase their living standards), Shaanxi (where 180,000 families are to benefit), and in Shandong (where, through development of coastal lowlands, as many as 1.5 million families stand to benefit directly)."
1989,"CHINA: IDA—$109 million. The incomes of more than 1.5 million families are likely to increase through a project designed to assist the Shandong provincial government in its efforts to accelerate the development of its unproductive coastal lowlands for culture fisheries, intensify crop production in existing low-yielding areas, increase the value of livestock production and processing in the Tuhai river basin, and upgrade the production and processing of small livestock in the Yi Meng poverty area (one of the poorest in China), thus providing productive employment (primarily for women), alleviating poverty, and reducing income disparities. Total cost: $272.3 million."
1989,"CHINA: IDA—$106 million. Farm production and incomes will be increased in Shaanxi province, one of the country's poorest, through a program of investments in irrigation, other rural infrastructure, and in agricultural services. In addition, some 130,000 people will be provided safe and secure drinking water. Total cost: $237.5 million."
1989,"CHINA: IBRD—$300 million. Through provision of industrial credit and technical assistance, the China Investment Bank will be strengthened in both its traditional and new areas of activity, its resource base will be expanded and diversified, and investments financed in the modernization and restructuring of light industry and in the removal of operational bottlenecks. Total cost: $460 million."
1989,CHINA: IBRD—$154 million. Industrial-sector weaknesses will be addressed at the provincial level through a project in Tianjin that will attempt to assist the authorities there in the identification and resolution of policy and system-reform issues in conjunction with specific enterprise-level restructuring. Total cost: $227.6 million.
1989,"CHINA: IDA—$57 million. Textbooks will be improved at all school levels through a project that, by providing technical assistance and training to assist the development of publishing and printing institutions, as well as modern printing equipment for new and existing publishing facilities, will result in improved textbooks with respect to educational effectiveness, content, variety, and physical quality. Total cost: $ 114.6 million."
1989,"CHINA: IBRD—$137 million. The implementation of the first phase of the investment program developed as a result of a phosphate-subsector study, undertaken during project preparation, will be supported, thereby providing a model for future investments in the integrated development of phosphate mines and fertilizer plants. Institution-building assistance is included. Bilateral assistance ($100,000) is being sought. Total cost: $510.6 million."
1989,"CHINA: IDA—$52 million. Approaches that experiment, in three regions, with health-policy initiatives relevant to integrated health planning, chronic diseases, and health financing are designed to serve as possible models in other parts of the country. Total cost: $ 113 million."
1989,CHINA: IBRD—$70 million; IDA—$80 million. The construction of a 948-kilometer single-track rail line in Inner Mongolia running toward the industrial province of Jilin in the country's northeast will facilitate the movement of coal and other products between the two provinces. Total cost: $349.9 million.
1989,"CHINA: IBRD—$60 million; IDA—$50 million. A 319-kilometer four-lane highway in the important corridor between Jinan, the capital of Shandong province, and the port of Qingdao will be financed. Institution-building assistance and training are included. Total cost: $423.5 million."
1989,"CHINA: IBRD—$76.4 million. The operating efficiency and level of maintenance at the ports of Ningbo and Shanghai will be improved, physical facilities there will be expanded and modernized, and work on a comprehensive strategy for future port development in mideastern China initiated. Training and insititution-building components are included. Total cost: $340 million."
1989,"CHINA: IDA—$61 million. A Jiangxi provincial highway project will upgrade, through road and bridge construction, the heavily trafficked Nanchang-Jiujiang highway, and, through provision of technical assistance, address specific policy, institutional, and technological objectives in the highway subsector. Total cost: $109 million."
1989,"CHINA: IBRD—$36 million. The operating efficiency and level of maintenance at the port of Xiamen will be improved, physical facilities there expanded and modernized, and the environmental impact of port operations and expansion improved. Training is included. Total cost: $90.3 million."

1989,"While robust economic performance is a source of satisfaction for Chinese policymakers, widespread public concern over inflation has induced the government to launch a stabilization drive and to moderate certain aspects of the reform program. To regain price stability over the medium term, a series of administrative, monetary, and fiscal measures has been introduced. Administrative reduction of investment spending by state entities attempts to reach the root of the demand pressures. Control over monetary expansion and higher interest rates reinforce the curbs on spending throughout the economy. Finally, efforts are being made to augment tax revenues and compress the budget deficit, which, at about 2 percent of GDP in 1988, also fuels demand in the economy."
1989,"In addition to meeting in regular and executive session, the board also convened as committees of the whole and in seminars to promote more informal discussions with management on a broad range of issues without making decisions or providing policy guidelines. Topics covered in this manner, in addition to those already mentioned, included Bank lending for state-owned enterprise sector reform, the calculation of per capita GNP, Bank lending for agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa, and policies for industrializing countries and industrial restructuring. The board also discussed the policy framework papers for twenty-six countries that had been jointly prepared by Bank and IMF staffs and the countries concerned. Executive directors also attended a three-day colloquium on international-trade issues and the ongoing round of GATT negotiations. Convened as the committee of the whole and in informal sessions, the board also discussed issues of Bank/IMF collaboration in assisting member countries.6"
1989,"The global economy in 1988 staged a strong performance following adverse shocks of late 1987. In the industrial countries (that is, the high-income OECD countries),1 real gross national product (GNP) grew by 4 percent, while the corresponding figure for the middle-income and low-income countries was 5 percent. World trade grew by 9 percent in volume. These aggregates mask significant differences among country groups."
1989,"Fastest growing among the countries in the first group were China (at 11 percent) and India (over 8 percent); the newly industrializing economies (NIEs) of East Asia continued their strong growth, also over 8 percent as a group.

1989,"The recent buoyancy of trade should provide an excellent opportunity for strengthening and extending the Uruguay Round, the generalized system of preferences (GSP) scheme, and the Lome Convention. However, continued trade imbalances (see Table 2-1) maintain the pressure behind protectionism. These pressures make progress in the Uruguay Round extremely urgent. Fortunately, agreements by senior officials on several difficult and outstanding issues were reached in April 1989. Significant progress on the agriculture problem provided a major impetus, as did progress on intellectual property rights. Significant prog-"
1989,ress has also been made in parallel negotiations outside the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) on the important issue of services.
1989,"In the industrial countries, 1988 was a year of robust growth (see Table 2-2). Growth was led by fixed investment and supported by increased consumption and the expansion of world trade. The growth of real GNP in the industrial countries accelerated from 3.4 percent in 1987 to 4 percent in 1988, and the growth rate for the volume of world merchandise trade rose from about 6 percent to 9 percent. Private nonresidential investment advanced by some 11 percent in 1988, while consumption grew by 3.5 percent."
1989,"Gross domestic product also increased modestly in the countries of sub-Saharan Africa, after declining in the previous year. The increase was not enough to effect a rise in per capita GDP in the face of rapid population growth. Growth was aided by a return to normal weather conditions (prompting, for the most part, an increase in per capita agricultural production), a terms-of-trade improvement (except for the oil exporters), and by the deepening structural adjustments that are being carried out by an increasing number of governments. In Nigeria, GDP is estimated to have risen by more than 5 percent, reflecting a 9 percent increase in oil production and a recovery in agriculture. Except in Mali, which suffered from adverse weather conditions, eco-"
1989,"Among regional groups in 1988, East Asia experienced a fall in its surplus of close to $20 billion, primarily due to a surge in imports, promoted actively through trade policies. For the entire middle-income group of countries (which includes East Asia), 1988 shows an aggregate deficit of slightly more than $12 billion, or a deterioration of close to $45 billion from the 1987 level. On an aggregate basis, the balance of payments of the low-income coun-"
1989,Commodity Prices and Terms of Trade
1989,"For the year as a whole, average annual oil prices were down by about 20 percent, although they began to recover after the OPEC production agreement of November 1988. Prices were also strengthened by the agreement, reached in the second quarter of 1988 by non-OPEC oil exporters, to cut back on production by 300,000 barrels a day. The higher prices of manufactured goods and metal ores, contrasted against low prices of oil, broadly tilted the terms of trade in favor of the nonoil producers. Oil exporters experienced a loss of 17 percent in their terms of trade, while nonoil primary-goods exporters registered a gain of 7 percent with, however, wide divergences in results among the nonoil group. Should the upward trend in oil prices continue, however, this pattern could be offset or even reversed in 1989. Table 2-8 presents a summary of selected global indicators of prices and costs relevant to development."
1989,World Trade Volume Increase
1989,"In 1988, world trade increased by about 9 percent in volume (see Table 2-9). Trade in manufactures was particularly strong (over 10 percent), as it responded to an investment and consumption boom in the industrialized countries. Among the developing countries, the principal beneficiaries of this trade increase were those countries that had reoriented their export composition toward manufactures, together with some metal exporters. (Exporters of manufactures include the NIEs of East Asia, as well as their ""second-tier"" competitors, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.)"
1989,"Notable among those with a decreased share in global trade were the exporters of tropical beverages, mostly in Africa, and the stagnating economies of the highly indebted, middle-income countries, largely in Latin America. Middle-income economies increased their imports by 13 percent above the 1987 level; among these, the highly indebted countries increased their imports by 8 percent, following two years of import contraction (see Table 2-10)."

1989,"• Asia, as Japan, the newly industrializing economies, and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries have intensified their relationships. In 1988, trade among this bloc of countries advanced by 25 percent in volume terms over the 1987 level;"
1989,"• The European Community, as trade among its members rose by more than 10 percent in volume in 1988; and"
1989,"• North America, as trade flows between the United States and Canada increased by more than 12 percent, while U.S. exports to Mexico rose more than 40 percent in volume terms."
1989,"According to rough estimates, trade was especially vibrant among the newly industrializing economies in 1988, as export volume advanced 18 percent and imports increased 23 percent. Trade among the NIEs grew by 38 percent, and the rise in imports from the highly indebted countries (55 percent) and other developing countries (28 percent) was significant. The NIEs appear to be emerging as potential engines for export-led growth for a broader spectrum of countries."
1989,"The momentum in world trade could be maintained by a successful conclusion of the current round of GATT trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round), scheduled for December 1990. Significant progress was achieved in the mid term review process that began with a meeting of trade ministers in Montreal, Canada, in early December 1988."
1989,"The meeting achieved consensus on a large number of specific agenda items, including proposals for immediate implementation of concessions by the developed countries on tropical products, strengthened rules for the settlement of disputes, and a new GATT mechanism for the review of trade policies. A framework for further discussion on services—technically not under GATT—was also agreed. Because of fundamental disagreements in four key areas, however—agriculture, textiles and clothing, intellectual property, and safeguards—all the agreements were put on hold until another high-level meeting in April 1989 in Geneva. Some countries (Australia, Austria, Finland, Japan, and New Zealand) announced that they would apply unilaterally their tariff-cutting offers on tropical products effective immediately."
1989,"Following a period of intense diplomatic activity led by the GATT's director-general, the progress of the Round was unblocked by agreements on the outstanding issues at the April 1989 high-level meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee. In agriculture, it was agreed that there was to be a ""substantial progressive reduction in agricultural support"
1989,"and protection."" The process and the timing are to be determined during the remainder of the Round. On trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights, it was agreed to examine the rules: Only at the end of the Round will it be decided whether such rules will be implemented through GATT or in the World Intellectual Property Organization. As for safeguards, on which discussions have been in progress for more than fifteen years, it was agreed to allow the drafting of a comprehensive agreement for negotiations."
1989,"Despite the progress on tariff-cutting in past multilateral trade negotiations under GATT, many nontariff barriers remain, and the tendency to use so-called gray-area measures, such as voluntary export restraints, as well as"

1989,"Also in mid June, two adjustment loans to Venezuela—for structural adjustment and in support of trade-policy reforms—were approved in the amounts of $402 million and $353 million, respectively. The former includes provisions whereby up to 25 percent of quick-disbursing funds ($100 million) may be used to support a debt-reduction plan approved by the Bank once conditions for second-tranche release had been fulfilled. The latter loan also provides for the use of 25 percent of the"
1989,"While a national EAP provides an overall strategy, it also makes recommendations for specific actions, outlining the environmental policies, legislation, and institutions required for implementation. The EAP, which is expected to be prepared by interested governments in collaboration with the Bank, is intended to provide a framework for integrating environmental considerations into a nation's overall economic and social-development programs. EAPs also identify a country's most urgent environmental needs and assist decisionmakers in determining priorities and allocating limited resources; by their nature, therefore, EAPs examine the trade-offs involved between investments and the environment for sustained development. In each of the action plans developed to date, participating governments have emphasized one theme: To be successful, environment must be fully incorporated into all their major programs."
1989,"The implications for Bank analysis and lending are obvious in human capital (education and training; health and nutrition; family planning). Perhaps less obvious are the important implications for poverty alleviation and basic development strategies; employment; agriculture and forestry; and household energy. There are some indirect implications for infrastructure (water, roads, and transport). The implications are more tenuous but not entirely absent for the basic macro policy fields—monetary and fiscal, trade, privatization, and public-sector management. Because adjustment programs can affect the entire economy, their effect on women can and ought to be considered. Finally, attention to women matters crucially in analyzing population and the linkages between economic progress, population growth, and environmental sustainability."
1989,2 Structural-adjustment lending was initiated in 1980 in response to the serious balance-of-payments problems—stemming mainly from a sharp deterioration in terms of trade and from a legacy of weaknesses in domestic policies and institutions—affecting many developing countries.
1989,"It was initially expected that structural-adjustment loans to a country would continue for three to five years. Adjustment lending has intensified, however, rather than disappeared, as developments in the 1980s departed greatly from what was expected at the start of the decade. The terms of trade for most developing countries deteriorated further, real interest rates increased, the debt crisis and worldwide recession spread, and industrial-country growth remained below the levels of earlier decades. Moreover, the scope of adjustment lending widened with the introduction of less comprehensive sectoral-adjustment loans."
1989,The reports of the two task forces also underline that these additional efforts need not involve a trade-off with efficiency because the scope for improving the productivity of the poor is very broad.
1989,"The task force concluded, therefore, that growth policies must be supplemented by clearly defined poverty-alleviation efforts and noted that evidence pointed to the economic feasibility of such an approach. Because areas of complementarity between the twin objectives of efficient economic growth and the alleviation of poverty exceed those areas involving serious trade-offs, pursuit of both objectives is essential to lasting and stable development."
1989,"trade-offs with efficiency standards, and the need for sustainabiiity was stressed."

1989,"Six major papers were discussed at the conference. They dealt with the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, savings behavior in developing countries, social-sector (mainly health and education) pricing policy, the role of institutions in development, the policy implications of the new strategic trade theories, and agricultural supply response and public policy. The conference began with a keynote address by Manmohan Singh, the secretary-general of the Geneva-based South Commission, and ended with a roundtable discussion by development experts on the major issues in development."
1989,"Other recent cooperative endeavors toward improving economic and social conditions in developing countries, particularly in Africa, are noteworthy. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)/World Bank trade expan-"
1989,"sion program provides technical and policy advice to countries intending to reform their trade regimes. The social dimension of adjustment program, presently being executed by the Bank in collaboration with the UNDP, the African Development Bank, and bilateral donors, helps ensure that the human dimensions of economic-adjustment programs are systematically taken into account in countries undergoing adjustment. The safe motherhood operational research program, created at the initiative of the Bank and executed by the World Health Organization, provides grants for studies on how to deliver maternal health care with greater efficiency and on the effect of such health care on the health and lives of women and their young children. The Bank and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) are actively working together through the interagency task force for child survival, established to promote initiatives aimed at protecting the world's children. Combined efforts with other agencies have resulted in an expanded immunization program for children worldwide. It is expected that many developing countries will reach full immunization by the end of 1990."
1989,"Participation in other OECD fora permits the Bank to bring its development perspective to bear and to integrate industrial-country issues into its own analytical and advisory work. Bank staff have recently participated in meetings of bankers, debt analysts, forecasters, environmentalists, and trade specialists. Meetings of the Economic Policy Committee have focused on agriculture, savings, and investment. The Bank attends the annual ministerial-level meeting, which, during the past year, concentrated on growth and global interdependence, including the Uruguay Round, the environment, and debt. Since October 1988, cooperation has been facilitated by on-line and direct electronic communications between the Bank and the OECD, making consultation and the exchange of data much more efficient."

Through media exposure, referrals by national investment credit insurers, direct mailings, participation in business and trade fora, and seminars, MIGA's guarantee program was successfully launched in fiscal 1989. By June 30, 1989, MIGA had received sixty-nine preliminary applications for guarantee, covering potential investments in twenty-four member countries. During the year, twenty-one additional preliminary applications were received for projects in fifteen countries that have not yet become MIGA signatories."
1989,"Reflecting normal weather conditions, a terms-of-trade improvement (except for the petroleum exporters), and continued structural adjustment, sub-Saharan Africa's gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have grown modestly in 1988, reversing the decline in the previous year. The recovery was shared by most countries in the region."
1989,"Civil war further disrupted production and exports in Somalia, adding to the difficulties created by the interruption of the adjustment program in September 1987. However, since July 1988, the government has restored fiscal discipline and embarked, once again, on a program of adjustment. Legislation has been enacted to eliminate state monopolies in banking, trade, insurance, and shipping, and a flexible exchange-rate policy has been pursued following a major devaluation in July 1988. In Rwanda, sluggish agricultural growth in 1988 may have resulted in a decline of per capita income. Depressed world market prices for coffee had an adverse impact on the balance of payments and the budget, despite measures to control expenditures. In Zaire, the pursuit of structural-adjustment reforms slowed down in both 1987 and 1988. The government's failure to curtail the growth of public expenditures resulted in runaway inflation and seriously hampered economic recovery. At the end of 1988, however, the government initiated a program to bring its expenditures under control and resumed structural-adjustment reforms, including adjustments in petroleum prices and tariffs for public services."
1989,"Development Coordinating Conference,1 and positive per capita income growth was realized for the subregion for the first time in a decade. Growth rates in GDP of over 4 percent took place in Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe; in Lesotho and Malawi, growth was of a lesser magnitude, but still positive. This favorable performance can be attributed to four factors: good weather, the initial benefits of economic reforms, notably in Mozambique and Tanzania, growth in donor-financed imports, some of which can be attributed to the SPA, and, in the case of Zambia, a terms-of-trade improvement."
1989,"An initial radical reorientation of exchange-rate and domestic-pricing policies has occurred in Mozambique and Tanzania, and both countries are now embarking on more complex second-stage reforms in the areas of trade policy and public-sector management (Mozambique) and agricultural internal marketing, public-sector management, and the financial system (Tanzania). In both these countries, the exchange rates are now closer to parallel market rates and to sustainable levels. In Tanzania, decontrol of prices has resulted in less than 15 percent of the ""consumption basket"" remaining under price controls, and the institution of a scheme that allows importers to use foreign exchange from unofficial sources to import a wide variety of commodities makes remaining controls irrelevant."
1989,"The number of adjustment loans approved by the World Bank to the countries in the region has grown from about five a year in the early 1980s to fifteen a year since 1985. Exchange-rate devaluation and trade reforms, increased producer incentives in agriculture, and restructuring of government finance and public enterprises have been the major components of structural-adjustment programs. Last year's"
1989,"In some countries, exchange-rate changes have resulted from the introduction of foreign-exchange auctions (The Gambia, Ghana, and Guinea, for example); in others, they have taken place through discrete devaluations (Madagascar, Tanzania, and Uganda). In the latter group, efforts have been made to introduce some degree of automaticity and transparency in the allocation of foreign exchange through, for example, open general licensing and other special schemes for importers and exporters.3 In most countries, agricultural producer prices are officially fixed, but these prices have been raised to a level higher than the rate of inflation by reducing taxes, improving efficiency of marketing agencies, or passing on the effects of devaluation. Other countries (Guinea, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, and Somalia) have liberalized their policies—either by eliminating fixed pricing and/or by permitting private trade to market the crops. In almost all cases, real prices that farmers receive have increased."
1989,"ress across countries and sectors make it difficult to draw general conclusions on the effects of these reforms. Nevertheless, evidence suggests that reforms are beginning to lead to better economic performance. In those strongly adjusting countries that have not been subjected to severe external shocks (both positive and negative), such as unusual weather or change in terms of trade, there is evidence that growth of output, exports, and per capita consumption during 1985-87 was somewhat higher than in those countries with weak or no reform programs (see Table 6-3)."
1989,"The economic expansion that marked the performance of many Asian countries in both 1987 and 1988 continued into 1989. Growth in gross domestic product (GDP) for Asian developing countries was 9.3 percent in 1988 and is projected at 7.6 percent for 1989. Many countries, propelled by a consistent record of macroeconomic stability and an enduring commitment to undertake structural economic reforms, have shared in this growth. Trade has played a"
1989,"In many countries of Asia, economic management is distinguished by two important characteristics: prudent macroeconomic management and an ongoing process of structural reform. The former can be seen in the successful avoidance of macroeconomic imbalances in most Asian countries, where low rates of inflation, modest fiscal deficits, and manageable levels of external debt generally apply. Underlying and complementing this macro stability of Asian countries is the attention paid by many governments to emerging structural problems in their economies and the continuing efforts to correct them through economic policy reform. In other countries that are contending with financial crisis and severe macro imbalances, these structural changes are necessarily compressed into shorter time frames and supported by programs of structural adjustment. Over the past year, the reform process and expanding international and regional trade have helped a number of Asian countries either to meet or exceed expectations in terms of their growth performance."
1989,"boom conditions due, in large part, to their timely adjustments to external conditions over a substantial period of time. For Thailand, the initial stimulus came from surging exports of manufactures (34 percent growth in 1987), which has since led to a major increase in investment. Private fixed investment rose 23 percent in 1988, and GDP growth accelerated by a record 11 percent. In Korea, GDP growth for 1988 was at 11.3 percent, with exports expanding at a 13.1 percent rate. Both countries are encountering some constraints to further double-digit growth, such as transportation and other infrastructural bottlenecks in Thailand, and growing labor problems, trade difficulties, and some inflationary pressures in Korea."
1989,"In Malaysia, growth has also been strong. Real GDP growth was close to 9 percent in 1988, and only a slight moderation of this rate is expected in 1989. Growth in manufacturing has been particularly robust (18 percent growth in 1988, 14 percent forecast for 1989). Evidence of the important structural changes that have been taking place in the economy is provided by the fact that manufactures now represent over 50 percent of Malaysia's export trade. Recent growth has also become more broad-based, with domestic demand becoming significant. As in previous decades, the important challenge for Malaysia is to sustain respectable rates of economic growth that also takes into account the need for equitable distribution."

1989,"The government also undertook measures to deregulate further the economy in three key areas. Two major packages of reforms in the financial sector were announced at the end of 1988 that provide for greater competition in the banking system and promote the development of capital markets. Another major set of reforms was announced in trade policy and included the removal of import-licensing restrictions in areas such as plastics, fertilizers, and agricultural products. Regulatory impediments have been reduced, thus easing the bias against foreign investment and making the local-content programs more flexible. In May 1989, the government converted the ""investment priority list"" to a short negative list, thereby increasing the transparency of the system and opening up new sectors to domestic and foreign investment. Finally, wide-ranging reforms in the maritime sector removed virtually all restrictions on entry by domestic and foreign shipping lines. These reforms result from the government's conscious strategy to expand the role of the private sector and remove constraints on private-sector development."
1989,"forms and increased aid disbursements in support of the country's adjustment program resulted in a much stronger fiscal position and contributed to a continued build-up of reserves. However, with the expiration of the bilateral trade and transit treaties with India in March 1989, Nepal's external trade was severely constrained, posing potential problems for economic growth and the pace of reform."
1989,"Given the acceleration of economic growth, it will be possible for the government to aim at a 6 percent growth target for the eighth-plan period (1991-95). However, tighter control of domestic demand, especially more stringent fiscal management, will be necessary to avert inflationary pressures that can jeopardize achievement of growth targets. Also crucial will be the continuation of the steady progress in industrial and trade reforms. The government, for example, has streamlined procedures for approving industrial investments, eased licensing and entry requirements for large firms, and reduced the number of products reserved for manufacture by small firms. Of particular importance for the future will be a more concerted assault on protectionist barriers in the trade regime."
1989,"Although the economy departed substantially from the more stable price regime of earlier years, those macroeconomic imbalances that had become very marked in 1985 were rectified. A balance-of-payments deficit on current account, equivalent to 4.6 percent of GDP, had been completely erased by 1987 through an increase in domestic savings. Rapidly growing exports of textiles, machinery, foodstuffs, and metal products, together with curbs on imports, were instrumental in narrowing the trade deficit to $3.8 billion from nearly $15 billion in 1985. Net medium- and long-term external borrowing, which climbed to $4 billion in 1985, also slowed, to $2.77 billion in 1987, thus stabilizing the debt-service ratio at 10.4 percent. The estimated current-account deficit for 1988 was a modest 0.4 percent of GDP, despite sharply rising demand for imports."
1989,"Uncertainties continue to affect Sri Lanka's economic performance. As a result, reconstruction activity was modest, GDP growth in 1988 was 2.7 percent in real terms, the fiscal deficit, inflation, and unemployment began to worsen, and foreign-exchange reserves to show an adverse trend. The government has indicated that it remains committed to economic reforms, and the Bank and other donors are working actively with it to improve policies in trade, public enterprises, and public-sector management."
1989,"In Pakistan, the most populous country in the region, the steady economic expansion, which has lasted throughout much of the decade, was accompanied by growing macroeconomic imbalances. In 1988, for example, the fiscal deficit, at 8.6 percent of GDP, reached its highest level in the past ten years. Despite strong export growth (24 percent in current dollars), the country's current-account deficit stood at 4.1 percent of GDP, well above the annual average of 3.3 percent experienced during the earlier years of the 1980s. A deficit of this magnitude is unsustainable, given Pakistan's low gross official foreign-exchange reserves and its relatively high debt-service ratio. By mid 1988, gross reserves covered but three weeks of imports, and the debt-service ratio stood at 28 percent. In response to the growing crisis, the government introduced significant fiscal and trade-policy reforms, and, in December 1988, reached agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank on a policy framework paper (PFP) that outlines government-reform proposals for the period 1989 through 1991. The program of reform, reflecting strong government commitment to adjustment and structural reform, seeks to redress the growing macroeconomic imbalances of recent years and increase economic productivity in the economy, as well as in the financial sector. Key targets, covering a reduction in the budgetary deficit, inflation, the external current-account deficit, and the external debt-service ratio, have been agreed upon. Once implemented, these reforms could result in a sustained real growth in GDP of about 5.2 percent in 1989 and of 5.5 percent a year in 1990 and 1991. The government has also stated that it intends to give greater priority to the social sectors, and the Bank has indicated its willingness to support these efforts. During the past year, the Bank gave considerable attention in its economic and sector work program to social-sector issues and to ways to alleviate poverty."
1989,"Yugoslavia experienced several economic developments similar to those in other highly indebted, middle-income countries. These included increasingly severe inflation (at over 250 percent a year) and a continued decline in GDP growth and consumption. The government has embarked on a major program of structural reform that stresses a more competitive and market-oriented economy. The Bank has provided extensive technical assistance in this effort. The constitution has been amended, and new laws are on the books that could fundamentally affect enterprise operations, foreign investment, and banking and financial operations. In addition, the government has been actively working with the Bank to identify policies to increase greatly both trade and domestic competition."
1989,"sector adjustment loan. Initial results, by and large, have been mixed. Gross domestic product remained constant (against a planned modest increase), exports to convertible-currency areas grew 9 percent in volume terms, and there was an improvement in the convertible-currency trade balance to an overall surplus of about $615 million. This improvement, however, was offset by a larger-than-expected deficit in the services account, with the result that the convertible-currency current-account deficit was about $100 million greater than expected. The government budget was also higher than planned, due largely to a failure to reduce sufficiently subsidies to enterprises."
1989,"Over the past five years, Morocco has undertaken important structural reforms, which, despite difficult circumstances, have led to considerable progress towards achieving internal and external equilibria. At the same time, the country has succeeded in achieving a modest growth rate with low inflation and avoiding the drastic decline in per capita consumption experienced by other highly indebted countries facing a similar deterioration in terms of trade. Morocco's reform program can be traced back to the balance-of-payments crisis of 1983 that"
1989,"caused the government to embark on a courageous stabilization and adjustment program supported by the Bank and the IMF. Since then, an active exchange-rate policy has resulted in a decline in the real exchange rate of 23 percent, which has helped proceeds from tourism and workers' remittances to be maintained at high levels and import demand to be contained following a reduction in trade barriers. Budgetary subsidies have been reduced by about 3 percent of GDP, and public investment has been rationalized. The government has also implemented comprehensive tax-reform measures that should improve allocative efficiency and ensure that the tax burden is shared more equitably. In parallel to the macroeconomic reform program, the government has implemented reforms at the sectoral level. Policy reforms at the macro level and in the industrial, agriculture, education, and public-enterprise sectors have been pursued. These sectoral reforms, supported by Bank lending and advisory assistance, have made the economy reflect more realistically, through a set of incentives, economic costs and benefits to producers and consumers. They have also made the budget cost of state intervention more transparent and have led to an improvement in the climate for private investors."
1989,"While there are opportunities for increased domestic savings in several countries of the region, a consensus exists throughout the region that revival of growth must rely on greater economic efficiency. The search for economic efficiency encompasses a wide agenda—sys-temwide reforms, corrections of economic distortions through greater reliance on market prices, better balance between the public and private sectors, and greater outward orientation of economies through trade reform."
1989,"mitting a greater role for markets and the private sector. In the socialist countries of the region, this means a fundamental reorientation of the economic system to one that would permit a greater role for markets and decisionmaking and introduce private-sector activity in large segments of economies that had previously been in the public sector. In many cases, efficiency will not need to be achieved by privatization per se, but through competition where none existed before. Trade reform and an opening of the economy to foreign competition is often an important element in this process. In mixed economies, efficiency involves restructuring of public enterprises, helping them become more autonomous, exposing them to more competition, and, where appropriate, assisting in their privatization."
1989,"Several countries of the region are contemplating, or have started, systemwide reforms that involve greater competition through greater freedom of entry for firms and a more liberal trade regime; greater financial discipline through limiting access to the budget and the banking system; and a general easing of constraints on labor and capital mobility through bankruptcy laws or other measures. Such reform measures, for example, have been a major focus of Bank assistance to Hungary through industrial-restructuring loans. Furthermore, in Hungary, Poland, and Yugoslavia, the Bank is assisting governments design new frameworks to facilitate foreign ventures and direct foreign private investment. New laws for this purpose were passed by all three countries in fiscal 1989."
1989,"In the more market-oriented economies of Morocco, Pakistan, Tunisia, and Turkey, improving economic efficiency depends less on systemic reform than on realistic pricing of foreign exchange and credit and liberalization of the price, foreign trade, and investment regimes. Even in these countries, a serious reappraisal and redefinition of the role of the state and the rules of the game for public-sector enterprises are under way."
1989,"erating. The improvement in the region's terms of trade over the same eighteen-month period has partly offset, however, the effect of declining output per capita on income and consumption—except in the oil-exporting countries, which were hit by an additional decline in oil prices in 1988."
1989,The increased surplus in the region's trade balance with the rest of the world reflected both external and domestic factors. The sur-
1989,"plus was used to pay interest on external debt, although some countries managed to accumulate international reserves. For the region as a whole, the net transfer to foreign creditors was still larger than the trade surplus, however. For the first time since the beginning of the debt crisis in 1982, the nominal value of the region's total external debt declined, from $443 billion at the end of 1987 to $428 billion at the end of 1988. The reduction of long-term debt with creditor banks through buybacks and swaps programs amounted to about $17 billion in 1988, but, in early 1989, it declined in anticipation of major actions by creditor countries."
1989,"tainly has happened in Chile and Colombia. But in Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico, export earnings increased to record levels in 1988 without bringing about an accelerated recovery of output. In Mexico, imports increased in response to the liberalization of its trade system and the consequent transformation to an open economy. So far, Mexico's new level of imports reflects a change in the composition of output rather than a recovery of GDP per capita. In Argentina and Brazil, despite the increased availability of foreign exchange, the dollar value of imports did not increase be-"
1989,"The aggregate resource, or trade, balance of the region in 1988 showed a surplus of $25.6 billion, an increase of $7.1 billion over the average of 1986-87. Box 6-1 reports on estimates of the resource balance for 1986-88 and its uses. For the eight highly indebted countries reported on in the box, the GDP-weighted trade surplus over that three-year period"
1989,"amounted to 3.1 percent of GDP. The trade balance of the eight countries ranged from a trade deficit of 1.4 percent of GDP in Venezuela to a surplus of 5.3 percent in Chile. A trade surplus, by definition, means that part of output is not used for domestic consumption and investment, and that it is used either by the public or the private sector to accumulate foreign assets (international reserves in the case of central banks), or to transfer resources to foreign creditors and investors. While Chile, Colombia, and Uruguay were able to accumulate reserves, other countries used reserves,"
1989,"especially Venezuela, where both the trade deficit and part of the net transfer to creditors were financed by depleting reserves. The use of international reserves and the trade surplus for the eight countries amounted to 3.6 percent of GDP over 1986-88."
1989,"In Chile, the net transfer to creditors was much larger than the total surplus (around 9 percent of GDP), and financing involved the attraction of significant capital inflows from foreign investors and other private sources. The growing inflow of capital allowed Chile to reduce its external debt without pressing domestic interest rates upwards. In Venezuela, the net transfer to creditors was also larger than the total surplus (above 4 percent of GDP), but there was little net inflow of foreign capital. Venezuela's private sector was able to service external debt with earnings from holdings of foreign assets, which are not accounted for in the balance of payments. Finally, the net financial transfer from creditors to Ecuador implied a resource transfer only in 1987, when the trade balance showed a deficit. Over the 1986-88 period, Ecuador had a trade surplus and a net transfer from creditors, and, therefore, there should have been capital outflows"
1989,"The region's net transfer to foreign creditors has been significant in the past three years, and most highly indebted countries have had to generate a large trade surplus to finance this transfer. Measures of the trade surplus at current prices do not take account of the deterioration in the terms of trade in relation to 1979-81, which is still significant for oil-exporting countries. But no clear relationship is evident between the trade surplus and economic performance in 1986-88. In particular, there is no indication that the trade surplus was an obstacle to the sustained recovery of output."
1989,"On the one hand, Chile, which has a trade surplus well above that of the other highly indebted countries, has been recovering; Colombia has also continued to grow while generating a trade surplus larger, relative to GDP, than some highly indebted countries. On the other hand, the deceleration of growth in Argentina and Brazil since 1987 has taken place at a time when export earnings have reached record levels; further, Argentina's net transfer to creditors since early 1988 has been lower than at any time during the past six years. Over the past three years, the major oil-exporting countries of the region have pursued different strategies for adjusting to the fall in oil prices, but the need for servicing their external debt has not been the decisive factor in defining the strategies. Venezuela was able to support economic growth until late 1988 by depleting international reserves. Mexico made a quick adjustment to the fall in the price of oil; although adjustment has not yet resulted in a sustained recovery, it has generated a significant trade surplus to service its debt. Ecuador, where troubles were aggravated by the 1987 earthquake, is still attempting to put together a strategy and has not been able to service its debt."
1989,"The analysis of export earnings and resource transfers in the period 1986-88 highlights three issues. First, export earnings have increased enough to ease significantly the foreign-exchange constraint. Except in the oil-exporting countries, the process of restoring per capita output, income, and consumption to levels that had prevailed during the 1979-81 period is no longer constrained by the availability of foreign exchange. Second, the trade surplus has been increasingly responding to domestic policies rather than to the availability of foreign capital and to debt-service strategies. The capital constraint has been eased in countries whose sound fiscal policies are attracting both national and foreign capital, the latter from various sources other than commercial banks,"
1989,"The Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic Development (CGCED) had another successful year in providing a productive forum for economic policy dialogue and for coordinating external financing assistance to its developing member countries. It has also facilitated regional efforts of the Caribbean countries to promote private investment, tourism, trade, agricultural diversification and development, health, and a variety of other activities; and it has heightened awareness of the environment as a necessary element of sustainable development."

1989,INDIA: IBRD—$30 million; IDA—$250 million. This first-ever Bank-assisted vocational training project in the country seeks to improve the efficiency of industry by providing well-trained workers (attention will be paid to promoting training for women in modem sectors and high-tech trades) in relevant skill areas. Institution-building assistance is included. Total cost: $429.8 million.
1989,MEXICO: IBRD—$250 million.

1974,"Though the primary commodity boom has played an important role in stimulating the economies of many East Asian countries, expansion has been most rapid in the Republics of China and Korea, and in Singapore. These countries are among the world's poorest in terms of natural resources; yet they have managed to build economies which are among the world's most dynamic."
1974,"The Republic of China, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand all have used exchange rate adjustments to dampen inflationary pressures which saw prices rise by about 8%. The Philippines, on the other hand, has preferred to maintain an exchange rate which would favor increased industrial exports. In the first half of 1973, inflation in that country reached 20% on an annual basis. However, food shortages and the boom in export prices caused a doubling in that pace of inflation in the second half of the year. And in Indonesia, after years of relatively stable prices, the overall price index has risen steeply in the past 18 months, and would have risen higher had the Government not sold large quantities of imported rice at prices lower than it paid for them."
1974,"The indications are that there will be a further decline in ODA in 1974. The question arises: to what extent will the decline be mitigated by flows of concessionary funds in 1974 and beyond? A number of initiatives have been taken in an effort to stimulate the flow of funds, both concessionary and other. For instance, the International Monetary Fund has established a special Oil Facility, to become operative in the immediate future. At a special session held in April-May 1974, the U.N. General Assembly considered the problems of raw materials and development. The special session was the first held solely to discuss development issues. The U.N. Secretary-General was requested to set up a coordination mechanism for emergency relief, and a fund-raising drive has been launched for this purpose. The Bank has been providing technical assistance in response to specific requests for information and expertise. The Bank has been requested to join with a number of international organizations — including the IMF, the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the United Nations—in assisting a committee to make recommendations concerned with a ""special fund"" for emergency relief and development assistance which that session decided to establish."
1974,"Among the major factors contributing to the need for a larger flow of external assistance to developing countries other than the major petroleum exporters is the sharp rise in commodity prices. Developing countries import substantial quantities of primary products, particularly petroleum, foodgrains, fats and oils, and fibers. Much of the supply of these commodities originates in the OECD and OPEC countries. The relationships between movements in the prices of primary products and the terms of trade of developing countries are, therefore, complex and affect individual countries quite differently."
1974,"The rise in the prices of most primary commodities—even in relation to the rapid rise in the prices of manufactured goods—has brought about substantial changes in the balance-of-payments prospects of many countries. The most significant change has been the sharp rise in the price of petroleum, particularly since it is so important among the commodities entering international trade."
1974,"The analysis indicates that the effects vary from country to country, depending on several factors. Inflation clearly has serious disruptive effects. However, it does to some extent reduce the burden of repayment and interest on existing debt. Before taking account of changes in the terms of trade, for example, the real burden of debt-service payments made this year on debt contracted five years ago has decreased"
1974,"A reduction in the real cost of debt-service payments under inflationary conditions, however, does not necessarily imply an improvement in the creditworthiness position and prospects of a country. If a country's terms of trade are unaffected by inflation, the capacity to import would increase in real terms, given the fixed nominal value of the debt-service payments. But any deterioration in the terms of trade would diminish that advantage. Frequently, developing countries have found that a deterioration in the terms of trade tends to more than offset the benefits of a decline in real debt-service costs; this has been particularly true of the lower-income countries."
1974,"Though all have been affected by increased prices for oil and manufactured goods, some countries have been able to more than offset increased costs for those items by the still higher prices their basic export commodities have commanded; others have found their terms of trade approximately unchanged; while for still others, the world price movements have been unfavorable. The category each country fits into has depended on the composition of its exports and imports, which, in turn,"
1974,East African nations exporting mineral products are not the only ones to have benefited from the year's shift in world commodity prices. Increased prices for wool—now declining slightly—have aided Lesotho's economy. The fourfold increase since 1969 in the price of sugar has enabled Mauritius to maintain its balance-of-payments equilibrium despite a rapid growth of imports and a deterioration in its terms of trade during the year. Increased prices for cotton have caused Sudan's economic situation to improve dramatically despite continuing deficits.
1974,"Though the economies of some countries have been strengthened through exports of valuable commodities, an even larger number of countries—Burundi, Ethiopia, the Malagasy Republic, Rwanda, Somalia, Swaziland and Tanzania — have found their terms of trade changed but little. Rising coffee prices have benefited some (Burundi, Ethiopia and Rwanda), but not enough—in Ethiopia's case— to overcome completely problems posed by other factors. Ethiopia faces an oil bill increased by more than $25 million in 1974. Though there has been a rapid growth in its receipts from hides and skins, oil seeds and pulses—as well"
1974,as from coffee—its terms of trade are expected to deteriorate in the near future.
1974,"In two countries of the region—Kenya and Malawi—recent movements in the terms of trade seem to have been adverse. The two have been affected in different ways, however. Malawi has found itself in an unfavorable position because its two main foreign exchange earners—tea and tobacco—have not risen in price; the country's terms of trade have deteriorated. But because export volume has been extremely buoyant, Malawi's problems are less acute than those facing many other nations of the region. Though price changes have been harmful, the country's rate of export growth, and the fact that it depends on petroleum only for transportation (electric power generation is largely hydroelectric), should protect Malawi to a greater extent than many others from any threat of serious economic hardship."
1974,"price rises. Its three major foreign exchange earners are coffee, tea and tourism. Only for coffee has there been any substantial price increase during the year. Overall, the commodity price boom has gone only a short way in offsetting the previous deterioration in the country's terms of trade, and any improvements whatsoever have been erased by rising oil prices. Again, unlike most countries of the region, Kenya's industrial development has been significant in the past few years. Thus, higher oil prices—the country has few alternative energy sources—have affected Kenya more than any other nation in Eastern Africa."
1974,"A survey of irrigation potential in the Sahel will examine alternative systems of irrigation and their costs, and will develop a program for the preparation of suitable projects. A regional forestry sector study, including forest products industries, and covering the major forest countries of Western Africa, seeks to identify policies and broad investment strategies that would enable these countries, both individually and as a group, to benefit more fully from their forest resources. A regional industry sector study encompassing Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Mali and Senegal is focusing on alternative industrial development strategies with particular emphasis on improved regional trade and promotion of small-scale industry."
1974,"An industrial estate project in the Yemen Arab Republic, for which IDA approved a $2.3 million credit in January, is notable in two respects. Firstly, it is the Bank Group's first industrial project in any of the 25 ""least developed"" countries, with the exception of enclave and DFC projects. Secondly, it is essentially a pilot project that is designed to serve as a model of industrial development in a country where the industrialization process has just begun. It will test how rapidly and effectively the traditional entrepreneurial skills of the Yemenis as merchants and traders can be transformed into those of investors and managers of"
1974,"industrial enterprises. The estate established under the project will provide a catalyst through which it is hoped to persuade traders, merchants and small-scale manufacturers to undertake the uncertainties and risks associated with longer-term investments. It will involve changes in the way they conduct their business, employ labor and sell their products. The hope is that importers of, say, furniture and footware will become producers, and that new investors will be attracted. The project will provide access to sound practical, technical and financial advice on such aspects as the choice of industries and market prospects, and on the day-today problems of the enterprises in the first critical years."
1974,"Similar patterns have prevailed in Indonesia and Malaysia. Both have experienced a fast-increasing demand for their primary exports, favorable changes in their terms of trade, and much improved balance-of-payments positions. These developments have further stimulated their economies which, by and large, had been growing at rates of around 6% in constant prices during previous years. In 1973, for instance, real national income—product at constant prices adjusted for changes in the purchasing power of exports—increased even more."
1974,"Others may fare worse. Sri Lanka's terms of trade are likely to deteriorate by 40% in the current calendar year (due to higher fertilizer and food prices as well as to costlier petroleum), with an adverse effect on national income of as much as 5%—far more than the equivalent of most major natural calamities. Though India may be able to adjust in the long run (its external trade represents only a small portion of GNP), it will be extremely difficult for it to do so quickly, as the cost of an unchanged volume of imports is expected to increase by about 30% in 1974."
1974,"MAURITIUS: IDA—$4 million. This project marks the Bank Group's first financing of a rural public works program which has the creation of productive employment as its major objective. It will provide temporary employment for 7,400 workers and will create 1,000 permanent job opportunities. Eighty-six villages will be provided with roads, potable water, health services, markets and community centers; trees will be planted on scrub land; and 3,000 workers will be trained in semiskilled trades. Total cost: $11 million,"
1974,"In addition to developing relationships in the course of regular agency operations, the Bank was a participant in joint efforts by several agencies responding to special development problems. These included collaboration with FAO and with the Special Sahelian Office of the United Nations in dealing with the drought emergency in the Sudano-Sahelian region of Africa and in meeting the medium- and long-term rehabilitation needs of the countries concerned. The Bank cooperated with the United Nations Relief Operations in Bangladesh (UNROB) and, in cooperation with the United Nations, sent a special mission to Pakistan, following the floods, to consider and propose immediate and long-term rehabilitation measures. The Bank is joining with the International Monetary Fund, the UNDP, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, FAO and the U. N. in assisting a committee to make recommendations concerned with a ""Special Fund"" for emergency relief and development assistance which the U. N. General Assembly decided to establish at its special session in April-May 1974."
1974,"THAILAND: Bank—$75 million. This loan, the seventh to the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand and its predecessor since 1957, will help finance hydroelectric facilities— a dam, reservoir, hydraulic structures, electromechanical equipment and transmission lines —at Ban Chao Nen, located 100 miles northwest of Bangkok. The Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan is lending $45 million for another part of the project. Total cost: $181.3 million."
1974,"Development Programme (UNDP) and various regional financing institutions, as well as with aid agencies in Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, lapan, Kuwait, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States, followed well-established patterns. In addition, for the first time, projects were financed together with the African Development Fund (the newly created soft-loan affiliate of the African Development Bank), and several Arab sources, including the Abu Dhabi Fund and the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, the Libyan Arab Foreign Bank and the State of Qatar. During the year, the Bank and IDA concluded a cooperation agreement with Norway which sets out the general scope, terms and conditions of future co-financing between Norway and the two institutions. A similar cooperation agreement with the Federal Republic of Germany is being prepared. In November, another round of consultations was held in Tokyo regarding the respective lending programs of Japanese agencies (the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund and the Export-Import Bank of Japan) and the Bank and IDA in developing countries around the world."

1948,"From the standpoint of the underdeveloped countries, the need to expand production and thereby to raise living standards is obvious. But the problem has direct and important implications for the more advanced nations as well. This is not only because the general conditions of poverty in the underdeveloped areas have created political and social tensions which, if unrelieved, may have serious and widespread consequences. It is also because full employment and effective utilization of the resources of the more developed countries depend largely upon a continually expanding world trade; increased production in the underdeveloped areas is one of the principal means to this end."
1948,"It was also necessary for the Bank to evaluate Mexico's general economic position and her ability to sustain the burden of additional foreign indebtedness, and for this purpose a mission headed by the Economic Director was sent to Mexico in August 1948. The Mexican economy expanded rapidly during the war, but difficulties encountered in the post-war period came to a head with the suspension of a fixed parity for the peso in July 1948. A rapid increase of population made necessary a high rate of capital formation, in the face of inadequate private savings and a fairly rigid pattern of external trade. Mexican governments had consequently tended to finance extensive agricultural, industrial and public utility programs by inflationary means which, in turn, had reacted adversely on the balance of payments."
1948,"Since the loans were granted, there has been a further depreciation of the peso and a fall in New York metal prices which adversely affects export prospects. However, production has increased, prices and wages have remained fairly stable, the trade deficit has been sharply reduced, the volume"
1948,"new Government has achieved substantial internal financial stability. Finally, Finland's debt record has been excellent and, viewed against the background of her foreign trade and favorable balance of payments prospects, the foreign debt is not excessive. The Bank also considered the fact that the deficiency of timber and wood products in Europe is being made up by dollar imports from the Western Hemisphere, and that development of production in Europe will contribute to reducing the size of Europe's dollar deficit."
1948,"The project has been approached as an experiment in the cooperative development of East-West trade in Europe. The proposed multilateral arrangements, however, have been difficult to work out and problems arising in connection with the proposed Timber Payments Agreements have not yet been resolved. Certain of the timber importing countries had indicated their willingness to enter into such Agreements provided that dollars obtained under the European Recovery Program could be used for that purpose. It now appears, however, that this will not be possible. Those countries are now considering whether or not to proceed with such Agreements on a different basis. In other respects, negotiations for these loans have reached an advanced stage with Yugoslavia, Finland and Czechoslovakia. Poland, in November 1948, advised the Timber Committee that it could obtain from Western Europe all the equipment it would need and would not require Bank financing for this purpose."
1948,"though moderate, additions to the Bank's loanable resources as a result of consents given by member governments to the Bank's use. of a part of the 18% portion of their capital subscriptions paid in in local currency. During the past year, Canada consented to use by the Bank in its lending operations of $8 million, the United Kingdom consented to the use of £500,000 and Denmark consented to the use of 599,876.25 kroner, from this source. It may be hoped that the change from a sellers' to a buyers' market in international trade may facilitate the Bank's efforts to secure additional consents in the future. It is plainly desirable that the non-dollar portion of the Bank's paid-in capital should increasingly become a substantial source of loanable funds in order to reinforce the Bank's international character and to enable it to realize its potentialities more fully."
1948,"sound financial and development policies, and in finding a satisfactory and lasting basis for economic cooperation with Pakistan will be of major importance in the realization of these prospects."
1949,"There have been significant additions to the Bank's loanable resources during the past year from sources outside the United States. A number of member countries have recently agreed in principle to the use for lending purposes of all or part of their 18% subscriptions to the Bank's capital. In addition, the Bank sold in Switzerland, in March 1950, a second issue of Swiss franc bonds in the amount of 28,500,000 francs. The market for the Bank's dollar bonds has also been broadened as a result of arrangements whereby the bonds have been made eligible investments for certain institutions in various countries other than the United States or have been permitted to be traded on local stock exchanges. These arrangements have already resulted in substantial purchases of the Bank's bonds by investors outside the United States."
1949,"economy of the borrowing country with a view to determining (a) the approximate amount of additional external debt the country can afford to service and the rate at which it can effectively absorb such debt, (b) the general order of priority of the projects under consideration from the standpoint of their contribution to the country's development, and (c) the appropriateness of the government's economic and financial policies to further the development process. Where the proposed project is in a country to which the Bank has not previously made a loan, this first stage frequently requires intensive study of the country's agricultural, industrial and mineral resources, of its manpower, transport and power situation, of the state of its external trade and balance of payments, and of the condition of its internal finances, particularly its budget and currency position. Where, however, such an investigation has already been made by the Bank, the inquiry will normally be confined to developments occurring since the earlier examination."
1949,"The economic and financial situation in Uruguay remains favorable. The Government has followed conservative monetary and fiscal policies, which have controlled inflationary pressures. During the year 1949 Uruguay had a surplus on her trade account as a whole.  The greater availability of"
1949,"goods from Europe made it possible to shift the procurement of imports away from dollar sources of supply into those markets where the bulk of Uruguay's meat is sold. In addition, exports to the dollar area increased. The balance of trade with the dollar area consequently showed substantial improvement. Wool, the principal dollar earner, maintains a satisfactory position in the United States market, although labor disputes delayed the shipment of the 1949-50 clip. The purchase of certain foreign-owned properties in the country with blocked balances caused total foreign exchange reserves to fall. Gold and dollar reserves, however, have risen. In general, therefore, the balance of payments position has strengthened"
1949,"impedes economic development and makes the budget problem more difficult. Moreover, the Indian Government has not found it possible to reduce military expenditures which still weigh heavily on the economy. India's economic stability would be seriously threatened by a continuation of the trade deadlock with Pakistan. Recent steps towards improved economic relations between India and Pakistan are, however, encouraging and, if they are followed by a lasting understanding and economic cooperation, a way will be opened for more rapid development of both countries."
1949,"The proposed improvement of the port of Bangkok calls for facilities at the terminal to reduce turn-round time and for the dredging of the channel through the bar at the mouth of the river Chao Phya to accommodate ships of 10,000 tons. At present, because ships of over 5,000 tons cannot cross the bar, expensive lighterage and trans-shipment charges have to be incurred and the expansion of foreign trade is retarded."
1949,"In spite of dislocation and destruction caused by the war, the financial position of Thailand is strong. Gold and foreign exchange holdings have greatly increased and the external debt is small. Trade surpluses have been steadily maintained, principally as a result of large exports of rice at high prices, and of rubber exports at twice their pre-war volume. It is expected that Thai rice will command good prices for some time. A conservative budget policy has kept the internal debt at a moderate level. Among countries in the Far East, Thailand has a number of comparative advantages, notably a lower density of population, a higher income per head and a more adequate supply of food. Thailand's major problem in carrying out its development program is likely to be the limited availability of domestic capital resources."
1949,"In October 1949 the Bank received the technical reports on the proposed hydroelectric projects on the island of Luzon, for which the Philippine Government had submitted a formal loan application in August 1948. While examination of these technical reports was proceeding in Washington, a Bank mission was sent to the Philippines to review the general economic situation on the spot. An assessment of economic developments during 1949 revealed a serious deterioration in the country's financial position. The trade deficit had reached record heights, foreign exchange reserves had been constantly drained in spite of extraordinary payments from the United States, and an unbalanced internal financial position had continued to maintain import demand at high levels. Steps to improve this situation, including the introduction of more stringent import controls, import credit restrictions, and a comprehensive exchange control, were taken early in December 1949; at the same time the Government undertook a review of its internal financial policies and of its economic development program."
1949,"The natural wealth of Iraq justifies a generally favorable outlook for economic development. In recent years, however, there have been a series of budget deficits, and an unfavorable balance of trade has caused a substantial contraction of Iraq's foreign exchange reserves. Measures have recently been taken by the Government to remedy this situation."
1949,"Turkey's sea-borne foreign and coastal trade is at present impeded by the inadequacy of its ports. Cargo-handling facilities are generally obsolete and many harbors are either overcrowded or unprotected. The program provides for the construction of new berthing and handling facilities in the major Turkish ports; part of these improvements is designed to service new grain elevators which are to be built under the grain storage project. On the Black Sea, where Turkey has no natural harbor, a new port will be constructed at Samsun to open up the potentially rich hinterland."
1949,"The cancellation reflected the development of Holland's trade relations in 1949, particularly after the devaluation of the guilder. As a result of the conclusion of a new trade agreement with Germany, considerable German mark balances accumulated in the hands of Dutch exporters which made it possible for Dutch industrial concerns to finance imports of equipment from Germany without recourse to the loan from the Bank. Procurement of industrial equipment in Belgium was financed with the help of EGA drawing rights and this also reduced the need for aid from the Bank. Moreover, some of the projects became too expensive after the devaluation of the guilder because of the higher cost of imported dollar goods."
1949,"Danish agricultural and industrial production has now largely recovered from the destruction and dislocation of the war. There were good harvests in 1948 and 1949 and investment has been maintained at a high level. Political stability and sound government financial policy have provided a basis for the effective utilization of the Bank's loan and other external financial aid. However, there is a deficit in both the dollar and the overall balance of payments. Denmark traditionally imports grains and oil-seeds to supply its highly organized dairy industry, the products of which form the bulk of its exports and are sold mainly to European industrial countries. As these and other essential imports such as cotton and petroleum must for the most part be obtained from dollar sources, Denmark will have great difficulty in balancing its dollar payments as long as European currencies, especially sterling, remain inconvertible. Furthermore, the 1949 devaluations, in which Denmark participated, have seriously affected the terms of trade. After the devaluations, the prices of Denmark's imports rose, while the prices of exports to the United Kingdom, its principal customer, did not increase since they are governed by long term agreements. These difficulties are not likely to be speedily or easily overcome. The Bank has continued to follow closely developments in the Danish economy and"
1949,"the Finnish markka in terms of United States dollars was reduced by 40%. In spite of the resulting deterioration in Finland's terms of trade, both the overall and the dollar balance of payments position improved during the year and prospects for the future are good. Reparation deliveries to the U.S.S.R., due to be completed by September 1952, have been made promptly. The conclusion of a trade agreement with the U.S.S.R. in June 1950, which provides for an exchange of goods equivalent to $352 million in each direction over the period 1951-55, should enable Finland to continue to export the output of the metal and engineering industries which were developed largely to meet reparations obligations. Internally, there has been a marked rise in the standard of living, but the present minority coalition government will probably have difficulty in keeping inflationary pressures under control, particularly in view of the substantial wage increases granted in 1950."
1949,"impedes economic development and makes the budget problem more difficult. Moreover, the Indian Government has not found it possible to reduce military expenditures which still weigh heavily on the economy. India's economic stability would be seriously threatened by a continuation of the trade deadlock with Pakistan. Recent steps towards improved economic relations between India and Pakistan are, however, encouraging and, if they are followed by a lasting understanding and economic cooperation, a way will be opened for more rapid development of both countries."

1961,"trade, and traffic includes about 5,700 ships calling each year to load exports or discharge imports. The economy of the Philippines, therefore, depends heavily upon keeping the harbors open. This has been increasingly difficult in recent years: formidable arrears of dredging have accumulated, partly because of wartime neglect, partly because of inadequate equipment, and partly because harbor extensions have enlarged the areas which must be kept clear."
1975,"Borrowings for development in the United States amounted to $1,146 million in 1974, up $618 million from the previous year. The World Bank borrowed $500 million as previously noted; Israel borrowed $560 million in the year; and a total of $86 million was borrowed by the Republic of China, Pemex of Mexico, public enterprises in Nicaragua, Panama, and a private financial entity in Venezuela."
1975,"inflation was a general decline in the prices of major primary commodities (excluding petroleum) supplied by developing countries. This decline came in successive stages throughout 1974; the downward movement of prices rapidly accelerated as 1975 began, and has continued ever since. On the other hand, prices of manufactured goods—which comprise more than two-thirds of the import bill of the developing countries—continued to rise. As a result, the terms of trade of most developing countries worsened. The purchasing power of exports of primary commodities is expected to decline by about 13% in 1975."
1975,"Many developing countries adversely affected by deteriorating terms of trade took steps to redirect production and investment. Egypt and India were among those that shifted their focus towards better utilization of installed capacity and away from the installation of new capacity Some countries shifted investment away from infrastructure and towards commodity production sectors. Many governments increased their investment in food production in order to avoid an abject form of dependence and to ward off the threat of starvation. A number of governments—including Ecuador, Bolivia, Ivory Coast, Pakistan, India, and Sri Lanka—greatly stepped up their investments to locate, develop, and exploit domestic energy sources."
1975,Trade Policies
1975,"In this context, it becomes essential to examine trade policies which can add to the export earnings, and hence to the growth, of developing countries."
1975,"Progress has been made in improving export possibilities, as exemplified by the recent agreement reached in Lome defining trade relations between 46 African, Caribbean, and Pacific nations and the European Economic Community. In particular, the mechanism included in that agreement for the stabilization of earnings from 12 commodity exports holds promise for the improvement of trade prospects of many developing countries. As the importance of trade in helping the developing countries meet the needs of their citizens looms ever larger, the trade discussions in various international fora have become all the more important. Trade-related negotiations between developed and developing countries under the auspices of both UNCTAD (UN Conference on Trade and Development) and GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) are currently under way."
1975,"Increased earnings by developing countries which produce primary commodities are not thwarted only by trade restrictions in the industrial countries. Another constraint is productive capacity in the developing countries themselves. A Bank study indicates that only by investing about $18,000 million (in 1974 dollars) by 1980 to expand production of these commodities could the developing countries take full advantage of the elimination of trade restrictions."
1975,"Import liberalization for primary commodities, though significant in overall terms, would nevertheless probably prove to be of limited value to the developing world over the long term. The markets for such products will continue to grow only slowly, as income elasticities are, in most cases, low. Improved long-term export prospects must, therefore, be based largely on trade in manufactures."
1975,"Although manufactured goods now account for 25% of the total exports of the developing countries, their share of the world trade in manufactured goods is still only about 6%. Moreover, exports of manufactures from developing countries have grown only marginally faster in value between 1960 and 1972 than total world trade in this category."
1975,"The fact is that developing countries with annual per capita incomes of above $200 would be the chief beneficiaries of export expansion and trade liberalization. The degree of their current dependence on world trade is far larger than that of the lower-income countries. Since 1974, external finance has been less used as a supplement to domestic savings as terms of trade deteriorated. Export growth can help return rates of domestic savings—and hence, domestic resources available for development programs—to more normal levels. But if long-term development is to proceed —especially for the 1,000 million people living in the lower-income developing countries—much larger capital flows on concessional terms must be provided."
1975,"There are but a few developing countries with highly diversified economies which can hope to achieve adequate rates of growth solely through export growth. For the rest, a combination of measures will be needed to enable them to pay for the imports required for sustained development. That combination can be provided only through cooperation among the industrialized, petroleum exporting, and developing countries. Expanded exports to and increased capital flows from OECD and OPEC members can help the developing countries weather the current transitional period of economic disequilibrium. Beyond this period, however, long-term development finance on concessional terms will be needed to help provide developing countries—especially the lower-income ones, whose dependence on foreign trade is relatively small—with the capital needed to finance programs designed to achieve basic development objectives which increasingly are"
1975,"All the countries in Eastern Africa are heavily dependent on the export of a small number of primary products to earn the foreign exchange required to pay for the increasing costs of imports. In fiscal 1975, as in the past, economic progress—or lack of it—in the region's 16 countries has been closely linked to the price trends of principal exports. Many countries, which had benefited from a boom in export commodity prices through mid-1974, suffered when their export earnings fell. Yet unfavorable movements in the terms of trade only partly explain the serious difficulties experienced by several nations; in Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, and Tanzania, continuing drought caused a major setback, while Mauritius suffered serious damage in January when it was hit by the worst cyclone in 15 years. In Ethiopia and Madagascar, the ability to deal with economic problems was affected by political changes, and the organizations of the East African Community were restrained from action by the need to negotiate further for agreement among the partner cou ntries."
1975,"Somalia's predicament was even more precarious during the year. A drought which began in 1973 became acute during 1974, and killed as many as a third of the livestock (some 1 million cattle and Vh. million goats and sheep). Nearly a quarter of a million people were fed in well-organized relief camps. Since livestock is the main source of Somalia's foreign exchange earnings, the drought caused a deterioration in that country's balance of trade. Despite large capital inflows, foreign exchange reserves declined in 1974 and continued to do so in the first half of 1975."
1975,"Although the drought also affected southern and southeastern Ethiopia, that country benefited—up to the middle of 1974—from a very favorable trend in its terms of trade. Since then, however, greatly increased prices for its imports have resulted in a moderate decline in Ethiopia's sizeable foreign exchange reserves."
1975,"Kenya was very adversely affected by a combination of deteriorating terms of trade and drought. As a relatively large importer of petroleum products, the country was also severely hit by the increased cost of oil. Foreign exchange reserves covered less than two months' imports at the end of 1974, and a residual external financing gap of over $150 million is forecast for 1975. To help maintain investment momentum, the Bank provided a $30 million non-project loan to cover the cost of essential imports while new policies relating to agricultural prices and investments, in particular, are taking effect."
1975,"financial constraints, the outlook for deteriorating terms of trade over a longer period, and the need to retain higher reserves and savings to meet the increased costs of investment. Generally, the situation in these countries could be regarded as providing temporary relief to hard-pressed budgets and as an occasion to increase allowances for future contingencies. Yet, some of them seized the opportunity to introduce extensive changes in the domestic price structure of tradeable commodities in order to pass part of the gains on to rural producers, and to reduce the burden on public finances of the high consumer subsidies (particularly on rice) that were introduced in many West African countries over the past two to three years; others, especially the petroleum producing countries, markedly stepped up their rates of public expenditure for development as well as for consumption."
1975,"The year was also marked by the signature of the Lome Convention defining trade and aid relations between 46 African, Caribbean, and Pacific nations and the European Economic Community and by increased attention to regional economic cooperation. The Convention's several innovative features include a scheme for the stabilization of export earnings from 12 primary commodities and their products, including such major exports as groundnuts, cocoa, coffee, cotton, timber, and iron ore, with preferential treatment to be accorded to the least developed and landlocked countries. Following the institution in 1974 among six francophone states of the Communaute Economique de I'Afrique de I'Ouest (CEAO), a draft treaty-establishing the 15-member Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) was"
1975,"signed in May. The latter community/1' will become effective upon ratification by at least seven member states. The West African Subcommittee of the Association of African Central Banks set up a clearinghouse to facilitate payments in the region so that intra-West African trade might be expanded. And spurred by the prospects for substantial international assistance in the development of the Sahel, the Organization for the Development of the Senegal River Basin (OMVS) made significant progress during the year. The OMVS, with headquarters in Dakar, seeks to promote the integrated development of the agriculture, power, transport, and mining sectors of the three basin states-Mali, Mauritania, and Senegal. The Bank has participated in the early planning stages, and a $1 million IDA credit was approved in May 1975 for the engineering of irrigation works in the Debi and Lampsar polders in the Senegal River valley."
1975,"For most countries of the East Asia and Pacific region, the past year was a difficult one, generally characterized by decelerating growth rates, worsening terms of trade, deteriorating balance of payments positions, and escalating inflation. While the region's aggregate Gross National Product (GNP) grew by some7% in real terms in 1974, most of this growth took place between January and June; the second half of the year saw a general pattern of decelerating growth. One cause of the less encouraging performance was a fall, beginning in mid-1974, in the world market prices of the region's major export commodities, notably rubber, timber, and coconut products. As a result, rural incomes which had benefited considerably from high commodity prices declined."
1975,"The terms of trade worsened for all countries in the region because of high import prices, mainly for fuel, foodstuffs, and capital equipment. The Republic of Korea's terms of trade index, dropping by 18%, was the most adversely affected. Even Indonesia, despite increased oil revenues, saw some deterioration in its terms of trade."
1975,"Because of the importance of international trade to these countries, imported inflation has been a major factor in domestic price escalation. For many countries, rising prices for petroleum products have been the primary element. For example, between 1972 and 1974, payments for imported oil increased almost fivefold to some $2,500 million for the Republic of Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand. The Republic of Korea, which depends on oil imports for about 60% of its fuel requirements, was hit hardest. Its oil bill rose by some $800 million in 1974."
1975,"The sharpness of the deterioration in the terms of trade, together with the extreme poverty of most of the countries, resulted in the placement of five of the six regional countries (Nepal being the exception) on the United Nations Emergency Operation's list of countries"
1975,"Bangladesh's terms of trade have deteriorated rapidly, with import prices rising by about 91% as against a rise in export prices of less than 30% between fiscal 1973 and 1975. Higher import prices could not be passed on immediately to consumers and, as a result, the budgetary deficit increased markedly. The high levels of deficit financing, combined with commodity shortages, led to a rapid rise in the pace of inflation. The Government attempted to minimize the effects of inflation by continuing to place large orders for foodgrains during the first half of 1974 in spite of the higher level of domestic"
1975,"Pakistan's economy has suffered from worsening terms of trade which, together with the floods in August 1973 and a long period of drought in 1974, held back agricultural production and the volume of exports. Terms of trade deteriorated by almost 16%. The value of exports of raw cotton, yarn, and textiles was reduced by a smaller cotton crop and by a sharp drop in demand. Imports of wheat and edible oil have also had to be increased to make up for lower-than-expected growth of domestic production. Pakistan's current account deficit may have nearly doubled when the figures for fiscal 1975 are tallied. The effects of the terms of trade deterioration were, however, mitigated in 1974 by the generous assistance Pakistan received from the members of OPEC. In the longer run, the trade picture should improve substantially as a result of projects under way to increase agricultural and other production. The largest of these is the Tarbela Dam. A series of mishaps, which took place when the initial filling of the reservoir began in mid-1974, necessitated a program of remedial works. They were completed"
1975,"Burma was an exception within the region in that its terms of trade improved with substantial price increases for rice (which accounts for nearly half of its total exports) and timber. However, stagnating agricultural production prevented Burma from taking advantage of this improvement, since an increasing population led to the further dwindling of its traditional export surpluses. Recorded rice exports, which had averaged 1.5 million to 2 million tons during the 1960s, stood at 250,000 tons in 1974. While increased agricultural production in Burma is, therefore, important because of its contribution to higher exports rather than through"
1975,"reduction of imports, Burma is in the same position as other countries of the region in that a vigorous agriculture sector is one of the keys to an improved balance of payments outlook. Nepal, which is also a net exporter of food-grains, faced a similar situation except that, given the heavy weight of petroleum, cement, and fertilizer in its import bill, its terms of trade deteriorated. As a consequence, Nepal, during the <year, faced its worst balance of payments situation in the past decade."
1975,"One of the countries most severely hit by the price changes was Sri Lanka. The price rises of a year ago aggravated the long-term decline in its terms of trade. Sri Lanka's major export commodities—tea, rubber, and coconut (together accounting for about three-quarters of total export receipts)—increased in price in 1974, although, except for major coconut products (150% increase), at relatively modest rates. The increases in world prices of Sri Lanka's major imports, however, were much greater than the increases in the country's export prices. Thus, the rise in the prices of its five major import commodities, making up about two-thirds of total import costs, ranged from a low of 100% (wheat flour) to a high of 250% (petroleum products). The result was a current account deficit in 1974 estimated at $193 million compared with $38 million in 1973. In the longer run, the expansion of agricultural output is the main remedy for Sri Lanka's balance of payments problem."
1975,"Developments in the region in fiscal 1975 were, as in the previous year, strongly influenced by the major international economic events of 1973-74. The events included the increase in the price of oil, worldwide inflation •and its impact on import prices, the deterioration in the terms of trade of developing countries, and the economic recession in the industrialized countries."
1975,"Greece, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, and Yugoslavia have, as a result of both the increases in the price of oil and capital goods and the economic conditions in those European countries with which they have close economic links, experienced serious deteriorations in their terms of trade, declines in their export volumes, and adverse effects on two major sources of foreign exchange earnings—tourism and workers' remittances. Morocco and Tunisia, however, experienced significant increases in export volumes (mainly on account of phosphates) and also a small gain in the terms of trade."
1975,"During 1975, however, market conditions for most of the region's principal export products deteriorated. Consequently, the terms of trade worsened. The relative decline in coffee prices has had a particularly widespread effect, because several countries in the region derive20% or more of their export receipts from this crop. Lower copper prices have adversely affected Chile and Peru, and lower wool prices, together with adecline in world market meat prices,and, even more importantly, a limitation of beef exports to the countries of the European Econom-"
1975,"For most countries, changing price and demand conditions are likely to mean larger trade deficits. In general, the possibilities for cushioning the effect of these deficits by drawing down reserves or running up short-term debts are limited. It thus seems likely that for most countries in Latin America, the recession in the industrialized world will lead to lower rates of economic growth, although the extent of this impact will vary according to their export prospects."
1975,"World trade conditions and their own economic structures are such that most countries— at least in the short run—will find it even more difficult to diversify their exports. As a result, there have been several attempts to reduce imports through policies designed to lessen aggregate demand. In Mexico and Peru, attempts have been made to combine demand restraint with efforts to sustain the level of development outlays. In Colombia, however, development expenditures had to be cut back as part of a stabilization program, but the fiscal reform measures adopted recently are expected to increase resources for development and also induce a more equitable distribution of income."
1975,"SINGAPORE: Bank—$25 million. An incinerator and about 200 refuse collection vehicles and dump trucks to be provided under the project will help free the limited land available to the island country for residential and industrial uSe. The incinerator will burn up domestic and trade refuse, and will also be designed to handle oil and other industfiar wastes. Total cost: $55 million."
1975,"Emphasis continues to be placed on such subjects as income distribution and employment, population, and rural and urban development with particular reference to the lower-income groups. In the past fiscal year, these subjects absorbed more than half the total expenditure of the program. The remainder consisted, on the one hand, of studies in specific sectors such as education, public utilities, industry, and transportation, including in the latter case, a major study of capital-labor substitution in civil construction in general; and on the other hand, of more general studies, such as those with a focus on international comparative analysis, for example, on the comparison of economic aggregates without relying on exchange rates, and analysis of structural changes in industrial production, trade, and employment. Some of the specific sectoral studies are themselves relevant to the problems of rural or urban development-a study of village electrification, for example."
1975,"The year was also marked by the signature of the Lome Convention defining trade and aid relations between 46 African, Caribbean, and Pacific nations and the European Economic Community and by increased attention to regional economic cooperation.

1975,"During the year, the Bank and IDA concluded a cooperation agreement with Germany which sets out the general scope, and terms and conditions for future co-financing with the Federal Republic. Consultations were held during the year regarding the respective lending programs of Japanese agencies (the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund and the Export-Import Bank of Japan); with the Abu Dhabi Fund, the AFESD, and the KFAED to determine possibilities for cooperation on specific projects; with the Commonwealth Development Corporation to review questions of common interest and to discuss country and project matters; with the African Development Bank, the European Development Fund, and the European Investment Bank (also to determine possibilities for cooperation on specific projects); and with the Inter-American Development Bank."
1975,"The CGFPI has its headquarters at the Bank. Its Chairman, nominated by the three sponsoring agencies, is Edwin M. Martin, former Chairman of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Moise Mensah, FAO Regional Representative for Africa, has been appointed Vice-Chairman and Executive Secretary. The CGFPI's budget will be shared by the sponsoring agencies in equal proportions. The participants in the CGFPI will be governments and international bodies which have, or intend to have, significant programs of assistance to the food systems of developing countries, drawn from traditional bilateral donors, multilateral aid agencies, developing countries, and ""new donors,"" i.e., members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and aid agencies of states which are members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC). The CGFPI is to hold its first meeting in July 1975. The agenda for the first meeting includes a review of recent and proposed investment for food production in developing countries, an analysis of the world fertilizer situation, and identification of priority topics for future work by the CGFPI."
1993,"Developing-country growth was led by the countries of the East Asia region (up 8.9 percent and paced by China's leap in output of 12 percent) and the Middle East, which ""benefited"" from the stimulus of reconstruction efforts. In sharp contrast, output in the republics of the former Soviet Union plummeted by about 20 percent. Declines in Central and Eastern Europe abated, however, and Poland's economy actually grew for the first time since undergoing ""shock therapy."""
1993,"Growth of GDP in East Asia of 9 percent in 1992 reflected mainly an increase in China's growth rate of 12 percent. Rapid growth has been a result of the shift to China, since 1989, of many production facilities from more mature economies in the region that are seeking to take advantage of lower production costs. In addition, there has been a strong increase in China's fixed capital formation, the result of the government's move toward market mechanisms that have boosted the confidence of foreign investors. With China serving as a ""growth pole"" and with a strong recovery of import growth in the United States, the traditional East Asian exporting economies were also able to accelerate their growth in 1992. There were a few exceptions, notably in the Philippines, where a stabilization program aimed at correcting severe external imbalances was the main cause of virtual stagnation."
1993,"Foreign direct investment in 1992 expanded beyond its traditional target of East Asia (Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand) as well as the historical (pre-1982) markets in Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and Venezuela) and reached other developing countries such as China, Egypt, and Nigeria. Factors contributing to the increase in FDI during 1992 included improved macroeconomic performance in many countries, more welcoming regulatory regimes, and privatization programs. Net flows of FDI in 1992 amounted to about $38 billion, 14 percent higher than in 1991 and about 60 percent higher than in 1990. The rapid increase in the stock of FDI, however, translated into larger profit remittances, resulting in a net FDI transfer of about $20 billion, which is about the same as that in 1991."
1993,"Cotton prices were kept at low levels during most of the year because of sluggish import demand from Europe and Japan and good prospects for production in the northern hemisphere. However, the market balance improved significantly towards the end of the year when adverse weather and insect damage reduced cotton production in Central Asia, China, and Pakistan, resulting in a 1 million-ton shortfall in world production for the 1992/93 crop year. Natural-rubber prices remained relatively stable, partly thanks to buffer-stock purchases by the International Natural Rubber Organization."
1993,"supplies resulted from increased exports from the republics of the FSU, weaker demand resulting from the economic downturn, relatively uninterrupted production (except for copper), and the failure of major producers to cut production. Copper fared better than other base metals because of major supply problems in Zaire and Zambia, phenomenal demand growth in China, and occasional fears that a major labor strike would take place in Chile (it didn't). The large outflow of exports from the republics of the FSU particularly depressed aluminum and nickel prices. Weakness in the German and Japanese automobile industries contributed to lower prices for lead, zinc, iron ore, and steel."
1993,"In value terms, world merchandise trade increased by 5.5 percent, a significant improvement over the meager 1.5 percent rate of growth in 1991, to reach $3,700 billion. Among the leading traders. China recorded the strongest expansion in both exports and imports, followed by Malaysia and Brazil (for exports) and Mexico. Portugal, and Saudi Arabia (for imports). France replaced Japan as the third"
1993,"By the end of fiscal 1993. a substantial number of IDA-eligible countries, including Albania, Benin, Burkina Faso, Egypt, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Honduras, Lesotho, Madagascar, Maldives, Nicaragua, Nigeria, the Philippines, Rwanda, and Sri Lanka, had completed their national environmental-action plans. National environmental-action plans are under preparation in virtually all other active IDA borrowers, and they are expected to be completed during fiscal 1994. National environmental-action plans for major IDA borrowers such as Bolivia, Burundi, China, India, Nepal, and Pakistan are expected to be completed in early fiscal 1994. Several borrowers from the IBRD have also completed EAPs (Botswana, Bulgaria, Poland, and Tunisia, for example), and EAPs are under way in most other middle-income countries."
1993,"twenty-four projects with primarily environmental objectives, involving commitments totaling $1.99 billion, were approved. (Projects are deemed to be primarily environmental if either environmental costs or benefits exceed 50 percent of total costs or benefits.) In fiscal 1992, nineteen such projects, with commitments totaling $1.2 billion, were approved. Several of the projects—in Bolivia, Chile, China, Ghana, and the Republic of Korea— focused primarily on the strengthening of environmental institutions or the provision of environmental technical assistance at the national level. In addition, another thirty projects contained significant environmental components."
1993,"A few countries have made gains in energy efficiency, including China, the Republic of Korea, and Malaysia. But many countries still live up to only two thirds to one half of their potential. Simple changes could save countries 20 percent to 25 percent of their energy production. With investments in new equipment, others could save as much as 30 percent to 60 percent."
1993,"The Bank will give priority to countries where water is scarce or where there are serious water allocation, service efficiency, or environmental problems. Many of the countries with limited renewable water resources are in the Middle East, North Africa, Central Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa, where populations are growing fastest. Elsewhere, water scarcity may be less of a problem at the national level but is nevertheless severe in watersheds, such as in northern China, western and southern India, western South America, and in large parts of Mexico and Pakistan. For some countries, such as those in Central and Eastern Europe, pollution is the largest problem affecting water resources."
1993,"The Bank's portfolio under implementation in fiscal 1992 comprised 1,852 operations with total lending commitments of $142.1 billion and an undisbursed balance of $73.3 billion. While the Bank was lending to eighty-three countries in fiscal 1992, the five largest borrowers—India, China, Mexico, Indonesia, and Brazil—accounted for 22 percent of the total number of projects and more than 44 percent of total commitments."
1993,"The focus of project-financing in CFS activities continued to be on large infrastructure projects, such as power and road projects, where large amounts of financing are required. In structuring these projects, emphasis is placed on mobilizing maximum amounts of private capital. However, the need for long-maturity capital has led to an increased demand for credit enhancement to mobilize private commercial debt. An important vehicle for such operations is the expanded cofinancing operation (ECO) program, which provides partial Bank guarantees to support borrowers in gaining access to syndicated bank loans and international capital markets. During the past year, interest has grown on the part of commercial markets and member countries in the ECO program as a means of catalyzing private financing in a broad range of developmental projects. ECO operations are under consideration in several countries, including China. Colombia, India, Pakistan, and the Philippines. An ECO for the 1,292-mW Hub Power Project in Pakistan is the most advanced; it is expected to be completed during fiscal 1994. CFS is also assisting in mobilizing private cofinancing not involving the use of the ECO program, such as in the case of the Rockfort Power Project in Jamaica. The project involves a privately owned. 60-mW diesel power station, which has attracted medium-term commercial cofinancing through the use of IBRD funds and cofinancing from the Inter-American Development Bank."
1993,"The OED's support begins after a country makes a commitment to develop its evaluation function. During fiscal 1993 the program was active in Brazil, China, and Venezuela. The OED also attended to requests for advice on evaluation-capacity development from Colombia, Indonesia, Mexico, and Zimbabwe and provided support to development institutions including the Caribbean Development Bank and the Andean Development Corporation. Activities included designing diagnostic studies on evaluation capacity, organizing training and workshops, organizing the participation of country staff in the OED's evaluation missions, promoting borrower participation in the Bank's evaluation processes, and organizing study visits to the Bank by staff from borrower countries."
1993,"The corporation approved projects in fifty-four countries, compared with fifty-one countries in fiscal 1992. It also approved a number of projects with a regional or international scope. As a result of the improved business environment in Asia, Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, and the Middle East and North Africa, IFC's approvals in those regions showed a marked increase over fiscal 1992. The corporation approved its first three projects in Russia (two oil-development ventures and a credit line to a financial institution), as well as its first projects in Lebanon since 1978. It also approved its largest investments to date in the Czech Republic and Poland and expanded its investment activities in China, with three new projects. In sub-Saharan Africa, as a result of the difficult investment"
1993,"In Africa, MIGA has issued guarantees for a cobalt-extraction project in Uganda, a foreign bank reentry into Tanzania, and a gold mine in Ghana; in the Middle East and Europe region, guarantees were issued to companies for projects located in the Czech Republic, Poland, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia; in Latin America, guarantees were issued for projects located in Argentina, Guyana, and Jamaica; and within the Asian region, projects were guaranteed in Bangladesh, China, and Pakistan."

FIAS also conducted seminars aimed at improving investment-promotion capabilities in Bolivia, Tanzania. Uganda, Viet Nam. and Zimbabwe."
1993,"During fiscal 1993, ICSID's membership continued to grow with the ratification of the convention by Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, China, Costa Rica, the Czech Republic, Georgia, Lithuania, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Turkmenistan. As of June 30, 1993, 109 countries had become members of ICSID; an additional fourteen countries had signed but not yet ratified the convention."
1993,"Not to be lost sight of amid the impressive averages for the region is its tremendous diversity. It includes the Republic of Korea, a country ready to graduate from the ranks of those called ""developing."" as well as the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) and Cambodia, which number among the world's poorest. The region includes China, the world's most populous country, and the Marshall Islands and Kiribati, two of the least populous. It also includes rapidly growing Malaysia and Thailand, as well as the Philippines, where per capita incomes have stagnated for more than a decade. Each country in the region must find its own way to deal with the challenges that confront it: for each country those challenges have a different degree of urgency and importance."
1993,"The composition of the Bank borrowers in the region is changing rapidly as well. Despite the perception held by many that the region is predominantly made up of market-oriented, middle-income economies, about 80 percent of the population lives in low-income socialist economies in transition (Cambodia, China. Lao PDR, Mongolia, and Viet Nam): another 15 percent lives in two large island economies (Indonesia and the Philippines), whose per capita GDP is barely above low-income classi-"
1993,"Some 1.3 billion people live in socialist economies in East Asia, three times the population in the states of the former Soviet Union (FSU) and Eastern Europe. Excluding China, the East Asian population living in socialist economies exceeds the total population of Central and Eastern Europe (excluding the FSU). China, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam have economically outperformed their European comparators, while Cambodia and Mongolia, for different reasons, face enormous obstacles in sustaining reforms."
1993,"China recorded the region's strongest overall economic expansion in 1992—12 percent. In some provinces—mostly in those coastal provinces that face the South China sea— growth rates were at historically unprecedented levels (20 percent or above). Exports increased about 18 percent, while imports rose an even faster 26 percent. Spurred on by continued policy liberalization and returning investor confidence, foreign direct investment flowed in at the record level of about $11 billion in 1992, double the amount registered in 1991. With the acceleration of growth, inflationary pressures are increasing. Although average retail prices in the country rose only some 5.4 percent in 1992, the cost-of-living index in major cities rose by more than 13 percent. Bold programs for trade liberalization and enterprise reforms have been developed that include efforts to introduce greater competitiveness and better incentives for the private sector. Reforms in the financial sectors, the social security system, and housing are also under way."
1993,"On the reform front, 1992 witnessed moves to widen still further China's ""open door"" to foreign direct investment, with particular reference to tertiary sectors such as commerce, insurance, and finance. The year also witnessed considerable activity in some of the traditionally sensitive areas of enterprise reform, including improvement of the legal/regulatory framework for shareholding enterprises and promulgation of a new operating mechanism for state-owned enterprises. The mechanism defines a wide range of powers to be exercised exclusively by enterprise managers, correspondingly excluding government"

Papers for the September meetings included one on resource flows to developing countries, one on trade-policy developments, and a report on the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. The papers for the meetings that began in late April 1993 included one on developing-country access to private capital flows and a progress report on private-sector development.14 The Executive Directors' Steering Committee reviewed the communiques released by the Development Committee following its semiannual meetings and made suggestions to ensure that the board's work program was responsive to the directions set out by the committee."

Although terms of trade in 1992 were not favorable to commodity-exporting developing countries, lower interest rates in major currencies tended to offset this negative effect in countries with large external debt. Overall, however, growth of all developing countries, including those of Central and Eastern Europe and the republics of the former Soviet Union, was slightly negative in 1992 (see Table 2-2)."
1993,"The abatement of hostilities in the Middle East and the ensuing reconstruction efforts have allowed the economies in that region to regain some growth momentum—even as growth rates were decelerating in most of Europe and the price of oil was declining. Growth in GDP was particularly high in Jordan, which had performed dismally in 1991 in the wake of the Gulf war. Structural reforms and liberalization in trade and exchange systems also resulted in continuing strong growth in Iran. In many North African countries, however, growth was slow for a variety of reasons: Egypt was in the process of adjusting its fiscal imbalances, and Algeria continued to be plagued by political instability. Although Morocco suffered from a poor harvest, it was"
1993,"In sharp contrast with the rest of the developing world, the decline of income in the Europe and Central Asia region accelerated further (to 14 percent) as many economies pursued dramatic structural adjustments following the disintegration of the Soviet Union; in addition, some countries were entangled in regional and civil conflicts. In the Russian Federation, all but a few prices (energy, certain medicines, precious metals, and freight and transportation tariffs were exceptions) were liberalized in early 1992. However, the effects of liberalization were somewhat blunted because production of many goods remained highly concentrated. The wholesale price of oil, which was raised sevenfold in May 1992, doubled again in September. Despite significant progress in the area of privatization, formidable legal, regulatory, and other obstacles to the emergence of an efficient private market economy persisted. Steps were also taken to liberalize trade and foreign-exchange regimes—although the government continued"

The growth of trade"
1993,"was largely attributable to the economic recovery in North America and to the continuing strong import demand in Latin America and Asia (excluding Japan), which was well above the world average. By contrast, the external trade of the republics of the FSU continued to decline sharply. Exports and imports of the low-income and middle-income economies, excluding the FSU. grew by 5.8 percent and 7.2 percent, respectively, compared with 8 percent and 9.4 percent, respectively, in 1991."

1993,"In 1992, many developing countries continued on the path of trade liberalization, while the Uruguay Round remained deadlocked and the risks from further postponement grew as various deadlines passed. Concurrent with the lack of direction and increasing uncertainty at the multilateral level, bilateral trade tensions also escalated as a result of protectionist pressures that often accompany economic recession. Negotiations over regional trade arrangements, however, became widespread among both the industrial and developing countries.

The European Community widened the scope of its trading agreements, reaching out to countries of the European Free Trade Association, to Central and East European countries, and, possibly, to countries of the Maghreb. In Africa, economic-reform efforts being carried out by a growing number of countries have improved the prospects and opportunities for regional economic integration, particularly to harmonize tax and trade policies within the region and to reduce barriers to the movement of production and goods across borders. Progress was made toward the establishment of an African Economic Community under the Abuja Treaty signed in 1990.

Changes in the world economy in the 1970s and 1980s had an adverse influence on the environment in which projects were implemented. These effects largely resulted from declining terms of trade, rising international interest and inflation rates, and declining capital inflows. The volatility of world petroleum prices also had a substantial negative impact.

The EDI's training program in South Africa has two major objectives. The first, based on the Bank's expertise, experience, and comparative advantage, is to contribute to the design and elaboration of sound, appropriate, macroeconomic development programs by training senior policymakers. The second is to contribute to the design and delivery of appropriate, equitable, and efficient urban services by training future local government officials and nongovernmental organization (NGO) personnel. Many of the new managers and policymakers have not been exposed to up-to-date macroeconomic and public-policy analysis and management concepts and practices. Neither have many of them had the chance to learn from comparative experience in other countries. Through a tailored program of short courses and seminars, designed and conducted in close partnership with groups of universities and local training institutions, the EDI expects to strengthen the knowledge base of these people, thereby leading to effective and efficient policy formulation and decisionmaking in a situation of difficult political and economic choices and tradeoffs."

The major area of emphasis continues to be poverty, equity, and social-welfare issues, although work in the areas of environmental analysis and human-resource development is growing. The economic transition in the republics of the former Soviet Union and in Central and Eastern Europe has increased work on reform of the public sector, development of the private sector, and economic management.

It also found surprisingly strong evidence linking long-term increases in productivity to investments in the narrow category of machinery."

As part of a four-day Bank/International Monetary Fund (IMF) seminar in November 1992, staff from both institutions met with international labor-union officials for discussions on the implications for workers of structural-adjustment policies financed by the two institutions.

Large Fiscal deficits (an average 11.4 percent of GDP) and high rates of inflation (an average 45 percent, with rates for Angola, Sudan, and Zaire exceeding 100 percent) continued throughout the year. Despite an increase in the volume of exports, the external sector did not do well, largely because of unfavorable terms of trade, which deteriorated by 6 percent. As a result, the region's current-account deficit widened to nearly 10 percent of GDP. Increased recourse to foreign savings was needed to meet the financing needs caused by larger domestic investment and consumption (some of it drought-related), which could not be covered by the sluggish growth in domestic savings. As in previous years, most countries could not fully service their external debt. Interest arrears continued to climb, reaching about $14 billion in 1992, or more than three times the level of 1987. Despite incidences of debt forgiveness and reschedulings, the region's debt stock changed little from the 1991 level when it amounted to 111 percent of GDP and 345 percent of exports. The annual debt-service ratio also remained high and unchanged at about 28 percent."

The agricultural growth rate declined further, to 0.6 percent in the early 1980s, but recovered to 2.4 percent in 1986-89. Data on food production, trade, and aid show a still bigger improvement than value added for the sector as a whole: Food production rebounded strongly, arresting the decline in per capita production after 1985, despite an acceleration of the population growth rate to 3.1 percent; the aggregate food imports of the region declined from 11 million tons in 1985 to 7.7 million tons in 1990: and food aid has been halved, falling from 4.8 million tons to 2.5 million tons. The countries that have shown significant improvement in agriculture in the past five years include Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Nigeria, and Tanzania. On the whole, adjusting countries have recorded higher agricultural growth than the rest."

Many African countries have extremely low production costs, relative proximity to European markets, and special trade relations with some European countries. It is possible, therefore, for African enterprises to capture enough of the projected expansion in world demand in a low-price competitive environment to contribute markedly to agricultural growth."

Reductions will proceed on a fast track for fifteen product groups, bringing tariffs to the new low level in seven to ten years.

In the former, agricultural output grew 8.7 percent, leading to a strong overall GDP growth of 7.2 percent, up from 4 percent during the previous year. The sustained growth in output was associated with a smaller trade deficit, lower inflation of about 6 percent by the end of the year, and a stable exchange rate. Privatization of state-owned enterprises continued, and new guidelines improved the openness of evaluation and bidding procedures. Significant reforms are also under way to decentralize public administration, banking, and fiscal policy. In Mongolia, GDP declined an estimated 7.6 percent in 1992, following a 9.9 percent drop in 1991. The level of external trade has not begun to recover from the collapse of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance trade and payments system; as a result, industries are facing shortages of key imported inputs. Electricity outages—resulting from a lack of spare parts and intermittent deliveries of petroleum products—are occurring."

The Philippines continued the tight fiscal and conservative monetary policies that were put in place in 1991, and the presence of macroeconomic stability has encouraged capital reflows from abroad, enabled reserves to accumulate, and dampened inflation to the single-digit level. The stringent stabilization measures have exacted a cost in economic activity, however, as GDP stagnated in 1992 after having fallen by 1 percent in 1991."
1993,"Most South Asian countries recognize that restructuring the relative roles of the public and private sectors is indispensable for sustainable growth. Recent progress is most evident in three areas: fiscal reforms, public-enterprise and regulatory reforms, and trade reforms. In the public sector, the primary focus is on structural reforms to underpin medium-term fiscal adjustment, particularly tax reform and expenditure reduction and restructuring, as well as promoting increased competitiveness of public enterprises through privatization, wider share ownership, removal of entry barriers, and. where necessary, liquidation."
1993,"In all economies of South Asia a restructured and more efficient public sector is only one component of the reform agenda. For sustainable growth, a rejuvenated and dynamic private sector must play a complementary role. Much remains to be done to improve the enabling environment for private-sector development (by expanding infrastructure, particularly in rural areas, improving the business environment through deregulation and trade and exchange-rate reforms, and developing the financial sector, for instance) and to support privatization efforts."
1993,"Significant progress was made during the past year in liberalizing the trade regime in a number of countries. For example, India initiated important reforms that eliminated quantitative restrictions on all imports of capital and intermediate goods, simplified the tariff structure, and reduced tariff rates for a wide range of capital and intermediate goods. India is now moving rapidly towards closer integration with the world economy."

The government of Nepal, for example, introduced measures in mid 1992 to promote private-sector participation in industry, and additional measures were introduced in February 1993 to improve further the economic environment through, for instance, the unification of the exchange rate, a move to full convertibility of current-account goods-and-services transactions, and the removal of a number of trade restrictions. India likewise reunified its exchange rate in late February, while Bangladesh unified its official and secondary exchange markets in January of the previous year. In India. Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, the removal of many restrictions on foreign direct and portfolio investments has resulted in a significant increase in expressions of investor interest (though increases in actual flows have been modest, except in the case of Pakistan, where portfolio and foreign direct investment has increased substantially in recent years)."
1993,"Adjustment lending rose $100 million over the previous year's level; three new adjustment operations were approved in the amount of $900 million, accounting for 26 percent of the lending volume. In India, the government's willingness to increase the pace of human-resource development, pursue public-enterprise reforms, and further liberalize trade and adjustment regimes provided the basis of two adjustment operations, totaling $800 million."
1993,"Almost all the Bank's member countries of the region—from Central and Eastern Europe to Central Asia—have embarked on a path of transformation that has few parallels in history. The reform agenda being followed by many countries in the region is wide, ranging from price and trade liberalization to privatization and the imposition of financial discipline on enterprises and to the creation of an environment conducive to new enterprise development. The diversity of country experience and implementation capacity has already become evident, reflecting, among other things, the historical and institutional heritage of each country, the duration of the reform effort, and political priorities."
1993,"In the countries of the FSU, output declines and inflation both accelerated in 1992 because price liberalization was not accompanied by any sustained reduction of financial transfers to state enterprises. Real GDP declined by an average of about 20 percent in 1992. A central factor underlying this large fall has been the breakdown in supply links among enterprises, both within and across states. This breakdown reflected not only the collapse of the prior system of centrally planned production and trade but also the decline in efficiency of the payments system and the acceleration of inflation. Interstate trade is estimated to have de-"
1993,"clined by about 50 percent between 1990 and 1992. Output declines in the smaller states of the FSU have tended to exceed the average, reflecting their greater dependence on interstate trade, substantial terms-of-trade losses (in the case of energy importers), and the loss of budgetary transfers from the previous Soviet Union budget, which, in some cases, exceeded 10 percent of domestic GDP."
1993,"Privatization of retail trade and small service establishments, using simple auction methods or employee buyouts, has progressed furthest. In several countries (Czechoslovakia, Hungary. Poland), small-scale privatization of commerce and retail trade has essentially been completed. In Romania, small-scale privatization is well advanced. Over 2,000 assets have been sold. 85 percent of the land has been given back to former owners, and practically the entire housing stock is privately owned. In the Russian Federation, more than 30.000 small enterprises have been privatized. In Bulgaria, restitution of property has been the main avenue toward privatization. A few countries, such as Lithuania, have privatized a large part of the housing stock, while Armenia has privatized about 90 percent of agricultural land."
1993,"Privatization in Central Asia has progressed at a slower pace than elsewhere in the region. In Kyrgyzstan, however, some 2,300 enterprises, mostly in the small-scale trade and services sector, and accounting for about 12 percent of total fixed assets, had been privatized by January 1993. Azerbaijan recently-adopted a comprehensive law that provides a sound basis for enacting privatization and enterprise reform."
1993,"Poland. After two years of declining output (of almost 20 percent), economic conditions in Poland improved during 1992. Despite a serious drought that affected all of Central Europe, overall GDP growth in 1992 is estimated at 1 to 2 percent. Industrial production, driven by a healthy expansion of exports, rose nearly 15 percent above the December 1991 level. Average inflation, which reached almost 600 percent in 1990, declined to an annualized rate of 30 percent in the second half of 1992. After incurring substantial reserve losses in 1991. Poland's external performance also improved: A trade surplus of about $600 million allowed the country to strengthen its reserve position to a level equaling the cost of five months of imports."
1993,"Private-sector activity has been largely responsible for the transformation and growth in the economy. Initially concentrated in trade and commerce, private-sector activity has since expanded to industry and construction, where it accounts for over half and a third of output, respectively. This expansion constitutes a positive response to the changes in the incentive environment and is indicative of the potential for growth in the Polish economy."
1993,"Industrial production declined by about 20 percent in 1992, while agricultural production, benefiting from a good grain harvest, was down by only about 6 percent. Part of the decline in production was undoubtedly due to the disruption of interrepublic trade following the formal demise of the Soviet Union. The continued problems with interenterprise supply links was also a strong factor."
1993,"Rapid privatization of most of the SOE sector, as intended by the government, will be a monumental task. Important progress, however, has been achieved in some areas of privatization. As part of a mass-privatization program (MPP), covering approximately 24,000 enterprises, vouchers were distributed to all Russian citizens beginning in October 1992 and began to be actively traded in large cities."" The MPP has already privatized some 600 medium and large firms through voucher auctions carried out in approximately 30 oblasts. Approximately 350 enterprises were privatized in April 1993 alone, and more than 1,000 enterprises are awaiting privatization through voucher auctions. Privatization in Russia in its initial stage has largely involved corporatizing existing public-sector companies and forcing them to operate in a commercial framework. Ownership transfers are leaving control of management largely in the hands of existing managers and employees. That, by itself, however, is an important step since it reduces the number of enterprises with access to central-bank resources or finance from the budget."
1993,"The establishment of stable economies with low tariffs has laid the basis for renewed discussions on regional integration. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) among Canada, Mexico, and the United States has been signed, but is still subject to legislative ratification. Although full implementation would occur over a fifteen-year period, NAFTA is a major step towards free trade among these three countries. Chile, which has indicated its interest in joining NAFTA, has also signed bilateral trade agreements with Bolivia, Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela."
1993,"The MERCOSUR Agreement among Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, also continues to make progress. Almost all tariffs within the MERCOSUR bloc would be eliminated by 1994. and a common external tariff will be adopted later in 1993. In the Caribbean, members of the Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM) have agreed to reduce their external tariff ceiling from 45 percent to 20 percent by 1998. Bolivia, Colombia. Ecuador, and Venezuela have also agreed to a free-trade arrangement to be enacted during the period 1992-95, along with a common external tariff to be adopted in 1995."
1993,"but, within the total, significant redeployments were made across service categories and countries in light of evolving conditions. Thus, resources for the Iran program were increased substantially in both fiscal 1992 and 1993 to update knowledge, to provide the government with policy advice in key areas (especially on trade and safety nets), and to lay the foundation for a gradually increasing lending program. Similarly, there has been an increase in the program of reimbursable technical assistance to the Gulf countries. Offsetting these increases has been a reduction in resources to Egypt from the high level reached in fiscal 1992, when substantial economic and sector work was completed."
1993,"COLOMBIA: IBRD—$250 million. The government will be helped to introduce and sustain financial and trade-policy changes in the agriculture sector, particularly through the elimination of subsidized interest rates and directed lending. Institution-building assistance is included. Total cost: $1,522 million."
1993,"COLOMBIA: IBRD—$50 million. The country's export-development process will be accelerated during the early years of trade liberalization through, in particular, the streamlining of trade-administration mechanisms and ensuring consistency with GATT requirements and by helping existing and potential exporters to better assess export markets, adapt products, build export-market share, and secure export financing. Total cost: $86.6 million."
1993,"ECUADOR: IBRD—$75 million.

1993,"GUATEMALA: IBRD—$120 million. The government's economic-modernization and social-development program, designed to strengthen public finances, improve the efficiency of public enterprises, further liberalize trade, promote financial-sector reform, and intensify efforts to reduce poverty, will be supported. Cofinancing ($75 million) is expected from the IDB."
1993,"JAMAICA: IBRD—$75 million. The remaining gaps in the country's adjustment agenda— involving trade reform, deregulation of key domestic productive activities, privatization, and reforms designed to enhance the business environment—will be addressed."
1993,"HONDURAS: IDA—$65 million. The institutional and regulatory framework of the transportation sector will be improved, and transport infrastructure in the country's main trade corridors will be improved and rehabilitated, thus supporting the government's export-led growth strategy. Cofinancing is expected from the IDB ($190 million), Spain ($50 million), the CABEI ($30 million), USAID ($20 million), and Taiwan, China ($20 million). Total cost: $545.7 million."
1993,"JORDAN: IBRD—$35 million.

They agreed that a minimum of 45 percent and up to 50 percent of IDA-8 resources should be made available to that region, if warranted by progress with their economic-adjustment programs. The donors also agreed to continue to support India and China, which receive a blend of IDA and IBRD funds, as well as other low-income countries outside Africa. Donors agreed, furthermore, that the nominal allocations of IDA-8 resources to India and China should not be less than under IDA-7, and that their joint share of these resources should be around 30 percent."
1987,"excluding Brazil and China, per capita output increased by only 0.4 percent."
1987,"Exporters of manufactures among the developing countries thus benefited greatly from the combination of the fall in oil prices, the weakness in nonoil primary-commodity prices, and the explosive increase in manufactures prices. In addition, the depreciation of the United States dollar provided a competitive edge for the exports of several of these countries, notably in Asia, which kept their exchange rates against the United States dollar fairly constant. In 1986, the 6 percent increase in export volumes, coupled with the 10 percent improvement in terms of trade, enabled manufactures-exporting countries to increase their imports by 10 percent and reduce their external borrowing. Their collective current- account balance swung from a deficit $9 billion in 1985 to a surplus of $6 billion. The GDP of these countries rose by 7 percent—slower than in 1985, but fully accounted for by the moderation of growth in China, which, in 1985, had been around 12 percent."
1987,"To get a mid-term reading on the effectiveness of its new activities under the five-year plan, the EDI conducted a series of field studies and other evaluations in 1986. The field studies, carried out with the help of the Bank's operations evaluation department, involved interviews with more than 700 former participants in EDI activities, mainly from Africa and China. The institute submitted an evaluation report to the Bank's executive board in April 1987. The main finding was that the activities emphasized in the five-year plan—policy-related training and institution building, especially in sub-Saharan Africa—are having a desirable effect. Also clear is that the exchange of experience in policy seminars has proved useful to participants, agencies, and countries, as well as to the Bank."
1987,"Eleven freestanding technical-assistance loans and credits were approved for a total of $136.9 million, up from a total of ten, amounting to $69.7 million in 1985.

1987,"Among the larger new UNDP-financed projects for which the Bank has been designated as executing agency are investment-planning and management for water supply and sanitation in Ethiopia; public-enterprise reform studies in Zaire; planning assistance to Chad; river-development planning studies in Senegal; economic management in China, as well as an umbrella project (under which there are numerous subprojects) there; consultant support to a Bank-assisted gas project in Bangladesh; strengthening irrigation planning and design capability in Nepal; improved water-delivery systems in Egypt; and interregional and global projects for biomass gasifiers and windpump evaluation."
1987,"Low oil prices resulted in a substantial reduction (by almost $4 billion) in the export revenues of Indonesia; China's export earnings from oil fell more than $3 billion, while Malaysia lost Si.6 billion in revenue. By contrast, the Republic of Korea's import costs declined by a net $2.8 billion, while those of Thailand and the Philippines, combined, declined by $1.7 billion in almost equal proportions. All countries benefited from the reduced interest cost of debt servicing, saving a total of $2.0 billion. The net payments position of the major countries ranged from moderate-to-strong surplus on the current account (the Philippines and Korea, respectively), through rough balance (Thailand), to negative (China, Malaysia, and Indonesia)."
1987,"The performance in the industrial sector in East Asian economies has exceeded that of other developing regions over the past two decades. The growth of industrial value added in the six largest countries in the region (China, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand) averaged 8.3 percent annually in the 1973-84 period, years that included two massive oil shocks and an ensuing world recession. In the recent five-year span beginning in"
1987,"1980, the dollar value of manufactured exports grew at a rate exceeding 8 percent. The economies of East Asian countries increased their share of world manufactured exports from 1.2 percent in 1970 to 6.4 percent in 1984. By 1984, Korea accounted for 1.9 percent of world trade in manufactures, China's share had soared from 0.5 percent to 1.3 percent, and sizable gains had been registered by Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines."
1987,"The composition of manufactured exports varies by country. Still, textiles and garments account for between 25 percent and 55 percent for China, Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand; in Malaysia and the Philippines, the semiconductor and electronics industries account for between 40 percent and 60 percent of manufactured exports; and, in Indonesia, semimanufactured goods account for 50 percent. While the exports of China, Korea, and Thailand are more diversified, diversification, by product and ultimate market, is important for the region."
1987,"Petroleum prices are obviously difficult to project. Those countries, such as Indonesia, and, to a lesser extent, Malaysia and China, which rely on petroleum exports for a sizable portion of their revenues, will continue to be exposed to major uncertainty. Even if prices recover somewhat, a return to the high levels of the 1970s, which provided windfall gains to exporters, cannot be anticipated."
1987,"After a slowdown in the first half of 1986, China's economy rebounded; real national income rose by 7.8 percent, below the double-digit growth rates achieved in the previous year, when the economy became overheated and inflationary pressures emerged. Industrial output grew by over 9 percent in real terms. Output of energy and raw materials has kept pace with overall industrial growth, and bottlenecks in energy and infrastructure have eased somewhat. Agricultural growth in 1986 was 4 percent, slightly above the level achieved in 1985. A striking feature of the rural economy was the continuing structural shift toward industry and other nonagricultural activities; as a result, for the first time, rural industrial output value exceeded agricultural output value."
1987,"China's balance-of-payments position, which had deteriorated markedly in 1985, improved somewhat in 1986. Exports increased significantly, as nonoil exports grew by 30 percent, easily offsetting the reduction in the value of oil exports. Imports remained roughly constant.

1987,"The economic backdrop against which the meeting took place was somber, marked as it was by stagnating trade and increasing protectionist pressures. Despite this setting, or perhaps because of it, the ministers were successful in resolving differences on key points of contention and reached agreement on an agenda for the new round, which will be more comprehensive than any previous round, as it includes negotiations not only on tariff and nontariff barriers, but, also, on such key issues"
1987,"The World Bank attaches great importance to the new trade round, as trade liberalization is a crucial element in the growth-oriented strategies of developing countries. Export expansion is needed so that these countries, in particular, the heavily indebted ones, can secure the foreign exchange needed to finance imports essential for growth and to bring about a reduction in debt-service ratios."
1987,"The Bank has actively supported trade liberalization through its adjustment lending. In three quarters of its adjustment operations, the Bank has assisted its borrowers to undertake reforms involving the removal of all types of obstacles to trade."
1987,"But, as President Conable told the delegates to the GATT ministerial meeting, the Bank's encouragement of trade outreach and open markets in the developing world cannot be effective unless the developed world recognizes the benefit to both sides of the trade equation and supports openness for everyone."
1987,"At that meeting, the Bank announced that it planned to organize studies and seminars related to GATT so that developing countries participating in the negotiations might have as strong an informational base and analytical support as possible for pursuing their own interests in expanding multilateral trade."
1987,The international economic environment in 1986 continued to be characterized by slow growth and depressed commodity prices. Growth of world output slowed from 3.1 percent in 1985 to 2.9 percent. Weakness in primary commodity prices caused terms-of-trade losses comparable to that experienced in the 1930s and reduced the effectiveness of adjustment programs in many developing countries; current-account surpluses and deficits among industrial countries rose from already high levels;1 and limited progress was made in obtaining the funds necessary to support successful adjustment programs in the highly indebted countries.
1987,"Sharp and largely unforeseen changes in relative prices and in exchange rates contributed to a general fall in the growth rate of output. Countries subject to unfavorable shocks reduced demand severely, while countries benefiting from relative price changes expanded only slowly. The decline in primary-commodity prices, particularly for oil, led many primary-commodity producers to impose contractionary policies, while financial and other constraints slowed the growth of demand in many countries that are net importers of primary commodities. In countries with current-account surpluses, appreciating currencies reduced the supply of tradeables and slowed investment growth; the corresponding increase in supply for countries with depreciating currencies was slow in coming."
1987,"Events in 1986 demonstrated the high degree of interdependence in the international economy. Many developing countries successfully implemented painful reforms in policy to adjust to deteriorating terms of trade and low levels of external finance. These adjustment efforts were made more difficult by slow growth in demand from industrial countries. In turn, the severity of adjustment in the developing countries reduced the growth rate of industrial"
1987,"countries' exports and output, and made it more difficult to reduce financial imbalances while achieving acceptable rates of growth. Increased tensions over agricultural trade and rising pressure for the imposition of stronger protectionist measures also hampered efforts at adjustment."
1987,"Low rates of demand growth contributed to another year of slow growth in world trade. The volume of world merchandise trade rose by about 3.5 percent in 1986, the same as in 1985, but well below the average prior to 1980. World trade in manufactures increased by only 3 percent in 1986, compared with 5.5 percent in 1985, owing to weak demand and a slowdown in export growth from countries with appreciating currencies. Oil exports rose by 9 percent in 1986, as consumption and stockbuilding increased in response to the price decline that followed decisions by some countries that are members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to increase production late in 1985."
1987,"Still, some important progress was made towards resolving the problems confronting the international economy. The depreciation of the dollar that took place should contribute, in the medium term, to a more sustainable pattern of trade and current-account balances among the industrial countries, and the fall in the price of oil should reduce efforts devoted to the extraction of high-cost energy. Inflation and interest rates in industrial countries declined; agreement was reached in Uruguay to begin the next round of negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT); an easier monetary stance and terms-of-trade gains led to an acceleration in the growth of domestic demand in Europe and Japan; developing countries continued their efforts to control inflation and reduce macroeconomic dis-equilibria; and many countries began to implement reforms to increase the efficiency of their"
1987,"public sectors, liberalize trade, correct overvalued exchange rates, and reduce the scope and severity of administrative controls."
1987,"1985. Declines in primary-commodity prices, stemming from weak demand in industrial countries and excess supply, severely impaired developing countries' terms of trade. The fall in the price of oil reduced the export earnings of oil-exporting countries by 34 percent in dollar value, and the depreciation of the dollar further reduced the purchasing power of their exports. Many of the poorer countries in sub-Saharan Africa suffered severely from the continued decline in nonoil commodity prices relative to the prices of their manufactured imports. Restrictive demand policies necessary to control inflation, reduce government deficits, and adjust to low levels of external finance continued to depress output in highly indebted countries.2"
1987,"The response of trade volumes to the depreciation of the United States dollar has been slow in coming. The volume of exports from the United States increased by less than 2.5 percent, while imports rose by over 10 percent. Although this relationship may be reversed in 1987, the principal effect to date of the dollar's fall has been to increase the nominal value of the trade deficit. Slow export growth in the United States reflects, in part, how difficult it is to reestablish foreign markets after a currency has been overvalued for an extended period. The depreciation of the United States dollar has depressed output in surplus countries, while in both surplus and deficit countries, the trade imbalance has widened in local-currency terms. The United States' balance should start to improve as trade volumes respond to the new set of relative prices. Adjust-"
1987,"In Europe, GDP growth rates averaged about the same as in 1985. Some increase in the growth rate of output in France was balanced by a fall in the United Kingdom (the result of the drop in oil prices), while GDP in the Federal Republic of Germany increased at about the same rate as in 1985. Currency appreciations, easier monetary policies, and improved terms of trade increased the growth rate of consumption. However, rising con-"
1987,"Although overall economic performance in 1986 was no better than in 1985, some momentum toward constructive change was apparent during the year and has continued into 1987. At the beginning of 1986, the economic situation of industrial countries was characterized by slow growth, high rates of unemployment, and large financial imbalances that threatened the sustainability of recovery and exacerbated trade tensions among countries. A particularly-troublesome issue at that time was whether the continuing rise in the current-account deficit of the United States could be financed without a rise in interest rates. It was feared by some that expectations of an imminent, sharp fall in the value of the United States dollar would lower external lending to the United States, thus requiring a rise in interest rates to continue to attract the necessary foreign finance. However, major changes in economic policies in industrial countries had been implemented that pointed, at least, to the beginning of a resolution of these difficulties. In the United States, the Balanced Budget Act of 1985, the first step towards reducing the external deficit, symbolized a shift in policy in the direction of fiscal restraint. The ""Plaza Agreement"" of September 1985, which provided governmental approval for the decline of the dollar, increased the likelihood that the large United States' deficit and Japanese and European surpluses could be reduced in an orderly fashion."
1987,"Further progress was made in 1986. The dollar depreciated steadily, and the rise in the deficit of the United States was financed in the context of a general decline in interest rates and a narrowing of interest-rate differentials. Cooperation among the major industrial economies thus succeeded in reducing the value of the United States dollar from its unsustainable level in an orderly fashion and without adverse repercussions on interest rates and other financial conditions. Agreement by contracting parties of the GATT to launch a new round (the Uruguay Round) of multilateral trade negotiations provides hope for a further liberalization of trade barriers."
1987,"excessive fall in global demand, and, perhaps, a recession. Nor has the specter of protectionist measures, which are abetted, in turn, by inadequate growth, diminished. Indeed, the current period presents a clear danger to a smooth resolution of trade disputes. In the United States, both the increasing (nominal) current-account deficit and slow growth of demand tend to generate continued pressures for trade restrictions, despite the depreciation of the United States dollar. In the surplus countries, currency appreciations have begun to affect the tradeables sectors, and weakening export demand has become a significant drag on growth of output and income. These countries thus find it more difficult to agree to increased liberalization of their markets."
1987,"These tensions may subside in the future as financial imbalances are reduced as a result of past dollar depreciation. Such hopes could be supported if a period of comparative constancy of major exchange rates could be achieved. The early months of 1987 witnessed the formation of a remarkable consensus among leading officials on the need to stabilize exchange rates (not necessarily to fix them, but to permit only slow movements, preferably in line with the underlying fundamentals). Investment, business confidence, growth, and foreign-exchange stability are now seen as closely linked. There is also a consensus that stable exchange rates cannot be achieved simply by central-bank intervention; stable and proper underlying policy relationships are required. Further, there is wide agreement that an aspect of this is the need for structural adjustments: labor flexibility, resistance to protectionism, liberalization of trade and financial policies, including greater reliance on market forces in agricultural policies."
1987,"The danger is that, while the world waits for these better policies, a series of aggressive and retaliatory actions in the trade field could result in a build-up of protectionist barriers. Such actions would have financially destabilizing and deflationary consequences. Moreover, barriers, once imposed, would be difficult to dismantle later."
1987,"In short, governments cannot afford to rest on the accomplishments of the past year. Progress in the upcoming trade negotiations is essential if confidence in an open trading environment is to be preserved. The new sense of progress in agricultural reforms needs to continue and bear fruit. To the extent that underlying disequilibria remain, cooperative efforts must be undertaken to secure adjustment of fiscal and monetary misalignments and to guard against a resurgence of global inflation in the medium term. Current financial imbalances"
1987,"can be reduced through market forces. For example, a fall in private capital flows to deficit countries would raise real interest rates and hence reduce investment, thus improving the current account. However, reliance on market forces alone to correct imbalances that have emerged from unsustainable and inconsistent macroeconomic policies is likely to produce severe and sudden losses in real income, as well as losses of financial and monetary control. Therefore, adjustment in the United States to a reduced level of dependence on external savings must be gradual and eased by higher growth of demand in other countries. Some fiscal expansion in countries with large surpluses appears to be a necessary component of this higher demand in the effort to maintain acceptable rates of growth of world output while reducing the budget and trade deficits of the United States."
1987,"Even given the most optimistic assumptions, however, a significant increase in GDP growth rates in industrial countries in 1987 is unlikely. The stimulus from fiscal policy will probably decline, particularly as real government spending in the United States now appears to be leveling off. Stabilizing reactions in Japan and Europe are occurring too late to prevent another year of slow growth there, although recent actions to increase spending in Japan do demonstrate a commitment to a more expansionary policy. It is unlikely that monetary policy in the major industrial economies will be as stimulative as it was in 1986. Almost certainly, the terms-of-trade gains of 1986 will not be repeated, as prices of oil and other primary inputs for industry can be expected to be considerably higher than in the past year. Thus, while the steps being taken toward an improved economic environment should facilitate higher rates of growth in the medium term, the severity as well as scale, of the present adjustment problems suggest another twelve months, at least, of slow growth in the world economy."
1987,"Developing countries' gross national income, or GNY (that is, GNP adjusted for terms-of-trade changes) rose by only 3 percent, or 1 percent per capita. Oil-exporting countries, in particular, suffered a severe deterioration in their terms of trade, and their per capita GNY fell by 12 percent. By contrast, the GNY of countries that are major exporters of manufactures increased by 7 percent per capita, as the prices of their manufactured exports increased strongly relative to those of their primary-commodity imports. The slow growth in output and declining real income of primary exporters followed the cumulative impairment in their terms of trade that had built up during the first half of the 1980s."
1987,"Because many developing countries still depend heavily on earnings from primary production, the fall in primary-commodity prices during the first half of the 1980s has greatly worsened their terms of trade, reduced the amount of resources available for investment, and contributed to the reduction of the growth rates of output and per capita income (see Table 3-3). The relative weight of external factors on the economic performance of countries is notoriously difficult to isolate; it depends on underlying economic structures, which, in turn, depend largely on past policy choices. Yet, the fall in commodity prices in the 1980s has clearly compounded the already severe adjustment problems of many developing countries and significantly hurt their economic performance."
1987,"The decline in the terms of trade of primary producers continued, and, in some respects, accelerated, in 1986. The dollar price of oil was cut in half, and the prices of nonoil primary commodities rose only marginally, despite the rapid depreciation of the dollar. Economies weakened by successive years of falling terms of trade and per capita incomes were again hit by a serious deterioration in the external environment."
1987,"Prices, earnings, and growth. Oil-exporting countries suffered a severe terms-of-trade loss in 1986. The spot price of oil fell dramatically, from an average $27 a barrel in 1985 to $14 in 1986. Over the past few years, slow growth in the world economy and the maintenance of high prices through production agreements had led to a general fall in the demand for oil and a fall in the market share of countries that are"
1987,"The sharp drop in the price of oil severely depressed the incomes of oil-exporting developing countries and reduced remittance payments and their demand for other countries' exports. They reacted to the 42 percent decline in their terms of trade by reducing import volumes by 22 percent in 1986. Their GDP fell by 1.1 percent, and GNY plunged by 10 percent, or by 12 percent per capita. The need to avoid even more severe declines in consumption meant that investment had to be cut back. The decline in imports and investment could have been twice as steep were it not for some increase in external finance. Oil-exporting countries, whose current-account deficit (excluding official transfers) rose from $2 billion in 1985 to $19 billion in 1986, were thus left with even lower productive capacity and higher levels of debt relative to their economies."
1987,"Thus, despite the sharp drop in the price of oil. the terms of trade of countries that export primary commodities other than oil improved only marginally. (See Table 3-4.) Although the GDP of these countries increased by an estimated 3.4 percent (a considerable improvement compared with the preceding five years), it was still far below historical rates for developing countries. Sub-Saharan African countries were particularly affected by low commodity prices. Many are heavily dependent on a few primary commodities for most of their export revenues, and they lack the flexibility"
1987,"In contrast to declines or stagnation in primary-commodity prices, the average dollar price of developing countries' manufactured imports rose by 17 percent, despite declines in local-currency export prices, due to the effect of the dollar depreciation. The average local-currency price of manufactures exported from major industrial countries fell by about 5 percent, as producers in countries with appreciating currencies cut their profit margins to maintain their market share. Low prices of fuel and other primary inputs permitted a widespread lowering of wholesale producer prices, both in dollar-bloc countries and elsewhere. Even so, dollar prices of internationally traded manufactured goods shot up dramatically."
1987,"Exporters of manufactures among the developing countries thus benefited greatly from the combination of the fall in oil prices, the weakness in nonoil primary-commodity prices, and the explosive increase in manufactures prices. In addition, the depreciation of the United States dollar provided a competitive edge for the exports of several of these countries, notably in Asia, which kept their exchange rates against the United States dollar fairly constant. In 1986, the 6 percent increase in export volumes, coupled with the 10 percent improvement in terms of trade, enabled manufactures-exporting countries to increase their imports by 10 percent and reduce their external borrowing. Their collective current- account balance swung from a deficit $9 billion in 1985 to a surplus of $6 billion. The GDP of these countries rose by 7 percent—slower than in 1985, but fully accounted for by the moderation of growth in China, which, in 1985, had been around 12 percent."
1987,"Recently, concern has been expressed over the size of trade surpluses achieved by some developing countries, particularly in their role in reducing demand for the products of industrial countries. For a number of developing countries with well-developed manufacturing sectors, the rise in trade surpluses over the past few years reflected the improvement in competitiveness as the United States dollar became overvalued. Higher surpluses were also encouraged by concerns over debt levels in today's uncertain international environment. For highly indebted countries, large trade surpluses are required in order to service their debt. Indeed, many of these countries are urged by private lenders to increase further their trade surpluses to reduce their reliance on ""new money"" to finance their interest obligations, and, ultimately, even reduce the size of debt relative to their economies."
1987,"Debt and financing. The past year saw little relief from the difficulties surrounding the financing problems of the highly indebted, middle-income countries. In some respects, the difficulties these countries experienced in managing their economies in the presence of excessive levels of external debt increased. The oil-price drop and stagnation in dollar-denominated, nonoil primary-commodity prices greatly complicated adjustment efforts. Worsening terms of trade and stagnation in export volumes meant that import volumes rose by only about 3 percent. Import volumes would have fallen had it not been for increased external resources; their combined current-account deficit increased from about zero in 1985 to $12 billion in 1986 (see Table 3-5). The GDP of highly indebted countries rose by only 2.5"
1987,"Formal negotiations of debt service permitted some developing countries to continue to run a sizable deficit on current account in 1986; even more severe cutbacks in their imports and in the exports of the industrial countries were thereby avoided. An important agreement was reached between Mexico and private creditors that provided for a restructuring of previously rescheduled debt of $43.7 billion, a commitment of $6 billion in new money, contingency arrangements for additional money in case of further deterioration in the terms of trade or weaker-than-expected growth, and a reduction of spreads on existing debt. Multiyear rescheduling agreements were reached with the Congo, Cote dTvoire, and Uruguay, with the latter two countries receiving new long-term loans under cofinancing agreements with the World Bank. Brazil, Nigeria, Poland, Uruguay, and Zaire also negotiated debt-relief agreements with the commercial banks. In 1986, developing countries restructured $71 billion in debt, received $2.6 billion in new money (not including loans under the Mexican agreement, which were disbursed in early 1987), achieved some narrowing of spreads."
1987,"countries. In addition, some have built up substantial arrears on both interest and principal that have not been regularized through rescheduling agreements. A growing reluctance by banks to increase their exposure, declining creditworthiness caused by terms-of-trade shocks, and a build-up of arrears in some countries do not augur well for the forthcoming rounds of negotiations. Nevertheless, the world faces many more years of these negotiations."
1987,"resources, liberalize trade regimes, and encourage greater private savings. The renewed commitment to appropriate macroeconomic and microeconomic policies, despite difficult political and social constraints, has been reassuring. The World Bank continued in fiscal 1987 to commit substantial resources in support of adjustments in highly indebted countries. This support is reflected in increased staff time devoted to their problems, assistance in mobilizing external finance, and increased lending. World Bank disbursements to heavily indebted countries rose by over 50 percent in fiscal 1987 compared with the previous year."

1987,"In the area of international economic environment, one study deals with the footware industry as a prototype of an industry's adjustment to nontariff barriers.

A senior-level dialogue between the Bank and the European Communities (EC) is a permanent feature of Bank cooperation with development agencies. During fiscal 1987, discussions with the EC focused on key development-policy issues, such as aid coordination in sub-Saharan Africa, the forthcoming negotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, international debt strategy, and relations with NGOs. Collaboration between Bank and EC staff on country economic and sector work also continued, as the implementation phase of the Third Lome Convention got under way."
1987,"The Bank-NGO Committee, a forum for discussions with a selected group of NGOs worldwide, held its sixth annual meeting in Washington, D.C. in November 1986. The committee was received by the Bank's president and reviewed recent collaborative initiatives, including the Bank's support to Togo to facilitate official cofinancing of NGO projects, ajoint Bank-NGO mission to explore possibilities for collaboration in Western Africa, and the extensive Bank operational program involving NGOs in the areas of population, health, and nutrition. Views were also exchanged on current issues on the international economic agenda, such as international trade, capital flows, and the effect of debt and adjustment on the poor."
1987,"Bank staff responded to many inquiries from the OECD secretariat, which was preparing a pilot meeting with DAC members and aid donors that are members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The meeting focused on the practical problems of aid coordination; the test case chosen was the coordination of technical assistance to the irrigation sector in Senegal. Bank staff also supported DAC's preparation of a number of studies, including papers on project-appraisal techniques and regional aid-coordination mechanisms. During fiscal 1987, regular consultations were also held between the staff of the Bank and the OECD on such ongoing issues as concessional flows, debt reporting and analysis, trade, research, and global economic prospects."

1987,"The deterioration of political and economic conditions in South Africa and the escalation of pressures, including economic ones, on the Southern African Development Coordination Conference (SADCC) states (consisting of Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe) can only hurt their economies, most of which are highly dependent on South Africa for trade, transport, and manufactured goods. South Africa is the major supplier of food, oil, spare parts, motor vehicles, machinery, and other manufactured goods; it owns or controls up to 40 percent of manufacturing activities in neighboring states and employs an estimated 1 million migrants from the SADCC countries; and because some 85 percent of the foreign trade of these nine countries goes through South Africa, any disruption in transport routes would seriously damage their economies, with adverse implications, too, for non-SADCC-state countries (for example, Zaire)."
1987,"marked improvement, as good weather, higher coffee prices, and lower oil prices helped improve the external terms of trade by over 20 percent."
1987,"The region's external terms of trade improved by 5 percent in 1986. The price index in current United States dollar terms for seven major exports (constituting over half the total value of exports) rose by 8 percent, while that for imports rose by 4 percent; while the price index for petroleum and petroleum products fell by nearly half, that for manufactures (which have a much larger weight in the total value of imports) rose by 20 percent. Changes in the terms of trade for individual countries, however, depended heavily on the composition of their exports."
1987,"Coffee-producing countries, such as Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda, enjoyed substantial improvements in their terms of trade following a windfall increase in the early part of 1986 in the world price of coffee, which resulted in an"
1987,"increase of 34 percent in 1986 over 1985. In contrast, Sudan suffered a decline of 6 percent in its terms of trade, as cotton prices fell by 20 percent, and because copper and cobalt prices dropped by 3 percent and 40 percent, respectively, only slight improvements in the terms of trade took place in Zaire and Zambia. The total value of exports (in current United States dollar terms) from the region rose by 4 percent, with especially large increases in Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, and Tanzania. Large declines, however, were registered in Mozambique, Sudan, and Zambia. The outlook for the region's terms of trade is not good, and a fall of 5 percent is projected for 1987. Contributing to this outlook is the return to a more normal pattern in the price of coffee, which dropped by nearly half between early 1986 and early 1987."
1987,"Notable policy reforms, directed at structural adjustment, were initiated in Burundi, Mozambique, and Tanzania, while creditable progress toward structural adjustment was made in a number of countries in the region. In Burundi, the government, supported by IDA and Special Facility for sub-Saharan Africa structural-adjustment credits and a standby arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), implemented its reforms in July 1986. The reform program includes the adoption of a flexible exchange rate and a restructuring of the trade regime. The Burundi franc was first devalued 15 percent in terms of the special drawing right (SDR) in July 1986, and, through regular monthly adjustments, it had depreciated 26 percent against the SDR by the end of April 1987. Measures to liberalize imports included the replacement of quantitative restrictions by import tariffs. Import licenses are now granted automatically, except for a limited number of goods. A major reform of the import tariff structure has also been implemented, and price controls have been almost completely eliminated. Finally, the preparation of a three-year, public-expenditure program was initiated."
1987,"In Mozambique, the government formulated an economic-rehabilitation program, which is being discussed with the Bank and the IMF, in an effort to develop a medium-term framework for improvements in economic performance. It will focus on exchange-rate and external-trade policies, pricing and marketing policies, the budget, and credit. Steps already taken include an 80 percent devaluation of the local currency; increases in utility charges, petroleum-product prices, transport tariffs, and beer and cigarette prices; and several tax and expenditure measures designed to reduce the government's deficit."
1987,"Madagascar depreciated its currency by 20 percent against a trade-weighted basket of currencies in August 1986 and by 5 percent in February 1987. In Malawi, the government devalued the kwacha by 10 percent in August 1986 and by 20 percent in early 1987. It has also begun to implement a comprehensive reform of the agricultural-marketing system, which includes a rationalization of the role of the state marketing agency and the encouragement of increased private-sector participation in marketing. The process of price decontrol has now been completed, and efforts are being made to improve the management of parastatal enterprises. Somalia is moving toward a more efficient mechanism for foreign-exchange allocations to meet the demands of the economy, especially in the private sector. A successful bimonthly foreign-exchange auction was introduced in September 1986, providing a dependable source of foreign exchange. Almost all"

The incentive system has been rationalized through trade liberalization and the dismantling of agricultural-pricing and marketing controls."
1987,"The further deterioration in the international terms of trade was the principal culprit. In 1986, primary commodity prices in real terms fell below their level of 1932, the previous low in this century. While the terms of trade of the developing countries as a group declined by 4.4 percent in 1986, those for Western Africa plummeted by 37.2 percent. This drop reflects the dominance of primary commodities, particularly oil from Nigeria (whose terms of trade fell by over 50 percent), in the exports of Western Africa. However, even excluding Nigeria, the terms of trade of the rest of the region deteriorated by 20 percent."
1987,"Inadequate data lend a certain haziness to economic trends, but the broad picture is clear. In 1986, Nigeria's gross domestic product (GDP) is tentatively estimated to have declined by about 3 percent, but, adjusted for the terms of trade, gross national income (GNY) fell by nearly 16 percent and per capita income by 18.5 percent. In the rest of Western Africa, growth in gross domestic product (GDP), which, in 1985, had exceeded population growth, is estimated to have been almost 3 percent in 1986, or about the same rate as population growth. Thus, the combination of good weather and policy reform resulted in a modest gain in per capita GDP in 1985-86 after the decline of 1980-84. However, the deterioration in the terms of trade wiped out these hard-won gains so that, according to preliminary indications, per capita GNY of Western"

1987,"The economic prospects of countries in the East Asia and Pacific region continue to be strongly influenced by external factors, and, despite the continued slow growth of world trade, overall performance has been impressive. World openness to manufactures is critical for the region's future economic performance, given its capacity to produce competitively and the weak prospects for commodity exports, particularly rubber, palm oil, coconut oil, and tin, in which the region is dominant in world markets."
1987,"prospects. Only by major efforts on the supply side have regional producers been able to improve their income terms of trade over the past decade. Most adversely affected in fiscal 1987 by low commodity prices was Malaysia, a nation also hit by low oil prices."
1987,"Developments in the industrial sector will be the key to the region's future performance. The countries of East Asia, during the 1980s, have exhibited high rates of industrial growth and above-average rates of growth in manufactured exports, buoyed by an outward orientation in the group of countries that are members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and by Korea, in particular, and by relatively low domestic price distortions and competitive exchange-rate policies. The region remains vulnerable, however, to external demands for ""balanced trade"" and other protectionist pressures."
1987,"1980, the dollar value of manufactured exports grew at a rate exceeding 8 percent. The economies of East Asian countries increased their share of world manufactured exports from 1.2 percent in 1970 to 6.4 percent in 1984. By 1984, Korea accounted for 1.9 percent of world trade in manufactures, China's share had soared from 0.5 percent to 1.3 percent, and sizable gains had been registered by Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines."
1987,"The greatest gains in recent years in terms of world trade in manufactures by countries in the region, reflecting the shift of the East Asian economies into more capital-intensive, high-technology areas, have been in the electronics, machinery, and transport industries. This shift in comparative advantage has been an economic priority for governments in the region, and efforts to promote foreign investment and technology transfer have played a role in hastening its development. Governments recognize that low-wage competition, as well as protection, will limit further large-scale gains in some traditional labor-intensive sectors (textiles and assembly) in the later 1980s and that smooth industrial change is important."

The past year has also witnessed an important shift in trade policy, with a move away from the cumbersome system of import-licensing restrictions. As a result of these adjustment measures, the current-account deficit was held to S4.1 billion (6.1 percent of gross national product (GNP)) in 1986."
1987,"The severe deterioration in Malaysia's terms of trade contributed to a drop of about 5.4 percent in merchandise exports. Imports fell by the same amount, however, as inventories were drawn down and imports of consumption goods were curtailed. As a result, the current-account deficit declined only modestly, from 2.5 percent of GNP in 1985 to around 1.8 percent in 1986. Although the debt-service ratio rose from 15.8 percent in 1985 to about 17.6 percent in 1986, Malaysia's repayment schedule remains relatively comfortable, the result of aggressive refinancing by the government in the past two years."
1987,"Important structural reforms initiated to facilitate sustained growth include a revised five-year plan and an associated investment program with an emphasis on rural development and employment generation, and on the efficiency of investment; a major tax reform to improve equity, rationalize protection to domestic industry, increase revenue collection, and, by 1988, to put into place a more efficient value-added tax in lieu of cascading indirect taxes; continued progress in liberalizing trade; and a rehabilitation program for government financial institutions. In addition, the government has committed itself to accelerated and more comprehensive implementation of land reform, in line with a general strategy to promote rural development and reduce poverty."
1987,"One of the few dark clouds on Korea's otherwise bright economic horizon is that cast by protectionism. The very success of Korea's dynamic export sector contains the seeds of trade friction in industrial countries, in general, and the United States, in particular. It remains possible that the present unease over the imbalance in trade with the newly industrializing countries of East Asia will escalate into intensified protectionism. The cost of such protectionism could be quite large for a country as dependent on trade as Korea."
1987,"• In the Philippines, the Bank is supporting that country's recovery program through quick-disbursing loans with a focus on macro-economic and sectoral policy reform. A $300 million economic-recovery loan was approved in March 1987, and additional amounts may be mobilized through cofinancing. Furthermore, the Bank is heavily involved in aid coordination through its chairmanship of a consultative group for the Philippines, which last met in January 1987 in Paris. In formulating its assistance, the Bank has cooperated closely with the International Monetary Fund, whose current standby arrangement with the Philippines reinforces the structural reforms supported by the economic-recovery loan. A concerted approach has been developed with regard to trade liberalization, government financial institutions, the tax system, public corporations, the public-investment program, and sugar and coconut development."
1987,"• The Bank continued to support the Chinese government's efforts to extend economic reform under the seventh five-year plan (1986-90) through a broad program of assistance. Following up the Bank's analytic work on China's long-term development prospects, the focus of economic work and analytical support to the government has been on reforms in the financial system and foreign trade and a number of specific subsectors. An increasing share of lending resources is being devoted to industrial development for upgrading technology, conserving energy, and strengthening enterprise management. There is also emphasis on infrastructure projects in energy and transport, areas in which shortages of supply and growing demand for service threaten bottlenecks."
1987,"• In Indonesia, the Bank is supporting government efforts to increase efficiency in the economy, especially in public enterprises; to promote nonoil exports; to improve the financial system and increase domestic-resource mobilization, especially through tax reforms; to improve environmental management of second-stage development needs in the transmigration program, alleviate environmental and conservation problems on Java and on the Other Islands, respectively; to decentralize more responsibilities to the local level, especially for urban services, roads, and the maintenance of irrigation; and to continue to place high priority on human-resource development. Especially noteworthy during the past year was the Bank's first policy-based loan to the country, for trade-policy adjustment, which supports efforts in trade reform, and an urban sector loan, which will finance a time slice of the urban-infrastructure program."
1987,"countries improved, relative to GDP. Export receipts generally increased, reflecting both expanding volumes and higher prices, while growth in import payments was restrained by expanding food and domestic energy production. Moreover, in several countries—India, Nepal, and Pakistan—improvements in the external accounts were aided by favorable changes in the terms of trade. On the other hand, the external sector was a source of serious concern in a number of instances, such as in Bangladesh, Burma, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, where tight foreign-exchange reserve positions and high and/or rising debt-service ratios presented difficult problems of economic management. To reduce distortions adversely affecting balance of payments, a number of governments introduced policies—including pricing, foreign exchange-rate adjustments, and licensing changes—to promote exports and efficient import substitution. Countries of the South Asia region adopting such policy measures included Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka."
1987,"tive restrictions. Thus, manufacturing industry has developed inefficiently, and manufactured exports have had great difficulty in competing successfully in world markets. Public-sector enterprises have proliferated in the past three decades, and most of those concerned with manufacturing have been neither profitable nor dynamic. In the past five years or so, governments, undertaking to define the precise nature of the obstacles to efficient production, have introduced measures to liberalize their economies and open them to the winds of competitive performance. Thus, deregulation, reform of trade policy, and provision of incentives to exporters are becoming commonplace."
1987,"export incentives, more open trade regimes, deregulation—will not only assist productivity, but can help overcome expected balance-of-payments constraints, as well. A number of governments, including those of Bangladesh and India, have combined internal and external trade reforms with a greater concern for price mechanisms, using internal pricing and foreign exchange-rate policies to encourage export-oriented activity."
1987,"The government of Bangladesh has stressed the need to provide greater freedom and scope for the private sector as a means of increasing competitiveness. After completing a major privatization of state enterprises in 1982, the government, in the past two years, has focused on developing a consistent and comprehensive set of industrial policies to make the private sector more efficient. It has permitted private enterprise to enter areas previously reserved mainly for the public sector and liberalized investment and trade policies. Starting in the late 1970s, the government undertook the difficult process of strengthening the nation's financial institutions so they could better finance the development of the private sector. Efforts to raise the public sector's efficiency— particularly the management of the public-investment program, energy policies, and institutions—have also been strengthened. The goals of these policies are to expand private investment, industrial jobs, and income for a rapidly growing labor force, as well as provide an increasing source of foreign exchange through heightened competitiveness of exports."
1987,"The Bank's program lending to Bangladesh, which has been the lynchpin of its lending relationship since that country's independence, has provided a useful vehicle for grappling with the issues of efficiency and international competitiveness, as well as the performance of state industrial and agricultural enterprises. In agriculture, Bank support has helped to finance the importation of agricultural inputs, while promoting pricing and irrigation policies that improve production incentives. Support to industry has enhanced that sector's capacity to contribute to higher growth rates, increased employment, and an improved trade and payments position."
1987,"Additional impetus to improve efficiency will come from trade-policy reforms. Recent export-promotion measures, such as those enabling exporters to obtain compensation for tariffs paid on imported inputs and to get credit at low interest rates, are intended to compensate exporters for the anti-export bias inherent in much of India's trade and industrial policy. As a result of these and other changes, manufacturers should compete abroad less hampered by cost-augmenting import duties or regulations restricting them from responding adequately to rapidly changing world market conditions. Firms able to enter foreign markets will be exposed to rivalry that should provoke continuous efficiency improvements. Competition from imports within India is limited, though, so this further source of stimulation to domestic entrepreneurs is currently weak."
1987,"Sri Lanka introduced a wide-ranging liberalization of its economy in 1977. That program, aimed at decontroling the economy, liberalizing trade, and placing greater reliance on market forces, worked sucessfully when tea prices surged in 1983 and 1984. Economic strains, which began when tea prices began a sharp decline in 1985, reflected the difficulty of undertaking strong adjustment with reasonable economic growth under adverse external circumstances. The 1977 economic liberalization also represented a major attack on some of the most serious sources of inefficiency in the economy. Nevertheless, two major sources of inefficiency were relatively unaffected by the liberalization process: the first concerned the country's public enterprises, which continue to be a major burden on the economy. With public-sector enterprises accounting for some 30 percent of gross domestic product, the task of improving their competitiveness is not only important, but complex and difficult, as well. The second concerned the continued high degree of protection enjoyed by most existing firms, both private and public, which encouraged them to produce almost exclusively for"
1987,"Progress in expanding exports in South Asian countries has been complicated by two factors, in particular: First, their economies are agriculture based, and the world demand for agricutural exports has expanded at a relatively slow rate as the pace of growth in the industrial countries has slackened; as exporters of primary commodities, export receipts have suffered from low world prices. Sri Lanka, for instance, dependent on export revenues from tree crops, saw prices for tea, rubber, and coconut all fall in 1986, and its terms of trade declined to 102 in 1986, down from 134 in 1984 and 108 in 1985 (1981 = 100). Second, progress in increasing exports of manufactures has been hampered by protectionist policies that have reduced the ability of manufacturing industries to compete in world markets. Since the early 1980s, however, governments have devoted more attention to the need to heighten efficiency and competitiveness through a variety of means, including more competitive pricing policies, the removal of many restrictive policies that were originally introduced to protect nascent industries, and by paying greater attention to foreign exchange-rate management. Nevertheless, the development of industries whose output is directed solely to the domestic market has meant products are often not of the standard, design, or quality demanded by export markets; the export response to policy changes thus may take more time for South Asian countries."
1987,"fiscal 1986, export growth continued to be sluggish.4 In the seventh five-year plan (1986— 90), the government has recognized the importance to India's long-term growth of an expanding export sector and the contribution that greater efficiency and competitiveness can make to the achievement of this goal. It is recognized that policies contributing to this end include easing of licensing requirements, more flexible pricing, and trade liberalization. Since fiscal 1985, several measures have been adopted to open up the economy. These have included greater entry possibilities for the private sector and a general loosening of controls. Measures have also been adopted to liberalize trade policy by easing restrictions on imports through reductions in import duties, rationalization of tariffs, and the provision of new incentives to exports. (See, also, the box on page 101.) While export growth in fiscal 1986 proved to be disappointing, there is some evidence of improved performance of manufactured exports in fiscal 1987. Bank assistance to India, described earlier, has also provided support to balance-of-payments improvements."
1987,"The currency was devalued, and tight fiscal and monetary policies were introduced. In order to strengthen the economy further, a structural-adjustment program was introduced in 1987, supported by an IDA credit. The main emphasis of the program is on improving the country's weak public administration, particularly as it affects budgetary processes and public-investment projects. Efforts are also being made to increase agricultural output, both to meet increasing internal demand and to expand exports. Fertilizer-distribution and pricing policies have been changed in line with the objectives of the structural-adjustment credit. In addition, a new seed act has been drafted. These actions are likely to improve the supply, pricing, and distribution of agricultural inputs. While some imports and exports have been liberalized, the government intends to undertake a more comprehensive reform of the industry sector and trade and tariff regimes in the near future."
1987,"A significant shift in the economic performance of the countries in the Europe, Middle East, and North Africa region occurred in 1986, in large part caused by the precipitous decline in oil prices. Overall growth, balance-of-payments pressures, and debt burdens worsened in oil-exporting countries, while several oil importers benefited from terms-of-trade gains resulting from both lower international prices (in dollar terms) of manufactured imports and lower oil prices to register their best overall growth in a decade. Yet, despite these short-term changes, efforts at stabilization and adjustment continue to be needed because of heavy debt burdens and persisting domestic and external imbalances."
1987,"Growth in gross domestic product (GDP) in the three major oil-exporting borrowers in the region6 declined from 3.5 percent in 1985 to less than 1 percent in 1986, as both consumption and investment slowed in response to a terms-of-trade decline of 39 percent (the worst decline in the terms of trade in twenty years). Expenditure restraint fell most heavily on investment, which suffered an extraordinary 19 percent cutback, while consumption declined only slightly. Particularly hard hit by the oil-price decline was Algeria, which, despite buoyant growth in export volume and good performance in the agricultural sector, suffered a terms-of-trade loss of over 50 percent and a decline in GDP growth from over 3 percent in 1985 to zero in 1986. Tunisia's terms-of-trade loss was less (13 percent), because net hydrocarbon trade accounts for a smaller share of its exports, but its GDP growth rate fell from almost 6 percent in 1985 to - 1 percent in 1986, in part, because of a drought that resulted in a 13 percent decline in agricultural output from its record 1985 performance. Egypt increased output by 2 percent in 1986 due to modest growth in industry, agriculture, and services. The real GDP of the high-income oil-exporting countries7 rebounded slightly from 1985's figure of -3.8 percent as oil output increased, but, in general, their nonoil production continued to decline as a result of cutbacks in imports, investment, and government spending— all resulting from declining oil prices."
1987,"Growth of GDP in the major oil-importing borrowers,8 however, increased from 2.6 percent in 1985 to 5 percent in 1986, buoyed by a 6 percent improvement in their terms of trade and strong growth in both consumption and investment. Among the oil importers, Turkey had the highest growth (7.9 percent), followed by Morocco (5.7 percent), Portugal (4.3 per-"
1987,"cent), and Yugoslavia (3.5 percent). Industry, agriculture, and services all grew in each country, with expansion in agricultural output in Morocco and Turkey (15 percent and 10 percent, respectively); particularly worthy of note was industrial growth of over 8 percent in the same two countries. In contrast, growth in Hungary was weaker (1.6 percent), reflecting poor performance in both industry and agriculture. Although Jordan, the Yemen Arab Republic, and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen are net importers of oil, they are closely linked to the high-income oil exporters through workers' remittances and aid flows; thus, despite terms-of-trade improvements, the net effect of the recent oil-price decline on their economies has been negative."
1987,The developments in the balance of payments of the region's major borrowers reflect both changes in terms of trade and concurrent adjustments in trade volumes. The terms-of-trade losses of the oil-exporting countries were
1987,"offset by a decline of more than one Fifth in import volume and a modest increase in export volume, leading to relatively small changes in their current-account deficits. The deficits of Egypt (18 percent of GDP) and Tunisia (9 percent of GDP) continued to be large, while Algeria's current account slipped from being virtually in balance from 1980 to 1985 to registering a 1986 deficit of 2 percent of GDP. Trade developments in the major oil-importing countries followed the opposite pattern. On the average, exports fell by 1 percent in volume terms after four years of rapid growth, while import volumes soared; however, because terms-of-trade gains counteracted these changes in volumes, negligible changes took place in current-account balances. In Hungary, however, which did not benefit from terms-of-trade improvements because of its particular trade structure, the current account (in convertible currency) suffered a major slide, from a 2 percent surplus in 1984 to a 6 percent deficit in"
1987,"1986. The pronounced drop in export growth in most major oil-importing borrowers is disappointing, considering the close linkage between trade performance and the long-run resolution of their debt problems."
1987,"Morocco was a noteworthy exception to these trade patterns. In volume terms, its exports grew by over 7 percent in 1986, while its imports increased only slightly; this, together with its terms-of-trade improvement, led to a decline in its current-account deficit to less than 1 percent of GDP, down from a high of 7 percent in the previous year. Despite enormous growth of 16.5 percent in import volume, Portugal also registered an improvement in its current account, due both to an increase in export volume and a significant gain in its terms of trade. This marks Portugal's fifth consecutive year of improvement in its current-account balance, which moved from a deficit of $3.2 billion (14 percent of GDP) in 1982 to a surplus of 4 percent of GDP in 1986."
1987,"In the 1987 fiscal year, the Bank assisted the process of adjustment and structural change in its regional borrowers9 with project lending throughout the region and with extensive adjustment lending (in Morocco, Tunisia, and Turkey). A first agricultural-sector adjustment loan to Tunisia, designed to rationalize agricultural pricing and improve efficiency and output in the sector, as well as an industrial and trade-policy adjustment loan to stimulate efficient industrial and export growth, was approved during the year. Concern with institutional development, efficiency in the public sector, and overextension of central government in the provision of services was a motivating force behind the public-enterprise restructuring loan approved for Morocco, as it had been in the education-sector adjustment loan approved in the previous year. An energy-sector adjustment loan was approved for Turkey, the latest in a long series of sector-adjustment loans to that country designed to deepen the process of structural change. This extensive adjustment lending aims at accelerating the process of managed structural change to which all three countries are vigorously committed."
1987,"• Although significant short-term social costs are often unavoidable in the adjustment process, a high priority of the Bank's adjustment lending is to increase longer-term labor absorption in concordance with other macro-economic goals. In Morocco, for example, where official statistics cite a recent rise in urban unemployment from 12 percent to 18 percent, a major aim of the Bank's two recent industry and trade-policy loans has been to raise the price of capital relative to labor, thereby increasing the incentive to employ labor in manufacturing. Rising real interest rates, a tightening of tax-depreciation rules,"
1987,"Similarly, the two nonproject loans to Tunisia approved in fiscal 1987 (agriculture, industry and trade) gave major emphasis to employment creation, again through a change in relative factor costs in favor of labor, and, also, through the stimulation of agricultural production and manufacturing production for export, both of which are particularly labor intensive."
1987,"Despite the recovery in some countries, per capita output failed to increase significantly for the sixth consecutive year for the Latin America and the Caribbean region as a whole; at present, per capita output remains about 8 percent below the 1980 level. Because of the cumulative deterioration, of 20 percent, in the region's external terms of trade that has taken place in the past six years and the rise in interest payments abroad, national income on a per capita basis is now estimated to be about 30 percent below the level of 1980."
1987,"On the plus side, major policy reforms have been initiated by most Latin American countries; many have strengthened their exchange-rate and interest-rate policies, and progress has been made in some in reducing large fiscal deficits and in pursuing more appropriate monetary policies. However, many other countries have been slow to undertake the types of comprehensive structural policy reforms that can lead to improved resource allocation and increased efficiency. Such reforms include rationalization of incentive and foreign-trade regimes, overhaul of public-enterprise systems, and implementation of institutional reforms aimed at improving the effectiveness of public-sector investment. In these countries, serious internal and external imbalances continue to impede sustained recovery."
1987,"Over the past year, most Latin American countries also experienced serious setbacks in their efforts to strengthen their external position and restore creditworthiness. These setbacks, in large part, were the result of adverse external developments. The surplus in the region's merchandise trade balance fell by 45 percent as a consequence of a 15 percent decline in export earnings and a slight increase in the level of imports. Except in Brazil, the decline of export revenues was primarily the consequence of further declines, by 12 percent, in world prices of most of the region's major exports; the region's external terms of trade fell by 9 percent after falling by 5 percent the year before. Because declines in world interest rates were not large enough to compensate for the deterioration in the region's merchandise trade balance, which fell from $33.5 billion in 1985 to $18.5 billion, there was a substantial increase ($10 billion) in the current deficit of the external accounts—from —$4 billion in 1985 to -$14 billion in 1986. Capital inflows were not sufficient to cover the current-account deficit and, as a consequence, international reserves fell by about $6 billion."
1987,"region's creditworthiness declined for the second consecutive year as a result of substantially lower revenues from exports. The debt-to-exports (goods and services) ratio increased from 3.2 in 1984 and 3.4 in 1985 to 4.0 during the year. And, although world interest rates declined, permitting the ratio of interest service payments to exports of goods and services to remain constant at 35 percent, the interest-coverage ratio (that portion of interest payments on external debt covered by the surplus on merchandise trade) fell from 80 percent in 1985 to 46 percent."
1987,"One of the most comprehensive programs of reform was initiated in Bolivia in August 1985. Constituting a coherent and comprehensive policy package to address the country's economic crisis, its focus, initially, was on stabilization, halting inflation, and restoring balance in the external account. The government also launched longer-term structural-adjustment measures aimed at dismantling most price controls, reforming the trade regime, restructuring ailing public enterprises, and overhauling the tax system. The government has pursued its economic policies with remarkable tenacity and has reduced inflation to less than 20 percent in the past twelve months."
1987,"During the past year, external factors, on balance, hurt the countries of Latin America. On the one hand, sharply declining world interest rates did contribute to the adjustment efforts of Latin American countries by reducing the outflow of resources required to service external debt; on the other hand, price declines of the region's major export commodities outweighed the positive effects of the decline in interest rates. The weakness of world commodity prices was related to slower growth in the industrial countries and to agricultural regimes in these countries that reduce market access of the Latin American countries. International trade can play a crucial role in supporting adjustment and resumption of growth of the Latin American countries—but only if strong economic growth in the industrial countries is restored and Latin American countries are given access to the highly protected markets that exist in a number of these countries."
1987,"After the promising start of its stabilization plan, which relied heavily on a price freeze, Brazil's efforts to reduce inflation proved unsuccessful. Although real gross domestic product (GDP) grew by about 8 percent in 1986, an overheated economy, coupled with the relaxation of price controls in the face of growing shortages and falling profit margins, raised the rate of inflation from about 1 percent a month in the months following the adoption of the plan to over 15 percent a month by the beginning of 1987. At the same time, Brazil's monthly trade surplus fell from $1 billion to about $100 million, as production for export was shifted to the domestic market. The consequence was a sharp decline in international reserves. Trade surpluses reached over $500 million in April, more than $900 million in May, and close to $1.2 billion in June. On June 12, the government took a series of measures to slash the country's inflation rate through a wage-and-price freeze limited to a maximum of"
1987,"Uruguay continued its efforts to stabilize and revitalize its economy, and concluded a multiyear rescheduling agreement with creditor banks that will provide relief equivalent to about $2 billion during the period 1985-89. The combined effect of these efforts created a favorable climate for expansion in the economy, which appears to have ended a four-year recession. Growth of GDP is estimated at over 5 percent for 1986, unemployment fell to below 10 percent, and export earnings increased by 24 percent. As a consequence, a trade surplus of about $200 million and a small current-account surplus was registered. Imports of capital goods also increased, sharply reflecting renewed private-sector investment activity."
1987,"Thus, in fiscal 1987, almost one third of the Bank's commitments to Latin American countries took the form of quick-disbursing loans. These loans supported adoption of tax reform, financial restructuring, rationalization of trade regimes, strengthening of export incentives, and improvement of public-investment planning and programming. Structural-adjustment loans of $250 million and $80 million were made to Chile and Uruguay, respectively. In Haiti, an IDA credit was designed to help the country reform public finances and economic policies, stimulate economic growth, and establish conditions from which retrogression to the inappropriate policies of the past would be difficult."
1987,"In Argentina, the Bank approved a $500 million trade-policy and export-diversification loan in support of government's efforts to improve export competitiveness and increase the efficiency of Argentine industry. A $500 million trade-policy loan approved for Mexico supports the government's implementation of trade reform as a means to improve industrial efficiency and international competitiveness. This loan complemented comprehensive financial and technical support by the Bank, including assistance in financing an export-development project to support diversification of exports other than oil for Mexico's trade-liberalization program."

Net disbursements of ODA from DAC countries represented 0.36 percent of these countries' GNP. Only five countries (Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden) provided more than 0.7 percent of their GNP in development assistance, which is the target set by the United Nations for the Second and Third Development Decades."

1978,"Considerable research in the Bank in the field of international trade has been prompted by the importance of trade prospects in the economies of the developing world. For example, a major study under way is designed to undertake a rigorous analysis of the subject through a cross-section investigation of the production of major export commodities and a time-series analysis of the effects of export promotion measures. It will evaluate the export promotion efforts of four developing countries: Brazil, the Republic of China, Greece, and Pakistan. The results will be used to formulate recommendations on the scope and methods of export promotion in developing countries."
1978,"The slow pace of growth of the OECD nations in 1977 was reflected in a slackening in the growth, by volume, of world trade. In 1976, a year of partial recovery from the recession years of 1973-75, world trade increased by 12% in volume, and by about 14% in US dollar value. In 1977, however, growth in the volume of world trade was only about 4%, far below the post-World War II period average of 7.2%. But the US dollar value of exports from developing countries (excluding capital surplus oil exporters) rose rapidly, by about 14%, in 1977. The export performance of the low-income countries and intermediate middle-income countries exceeded the average, rising 22% and 17%, respectively, while that of the upper middle-income countries was slightly less than 10% . The export performance of the lower middle-income countries was close to the average."
1978,"The continued increase in these values suggests that the competitiveness of developing country exports is not a transitory phenomenon, but is one that is likely to continue—barring increases in trade barriers. During 1977, however, additional trade barriers imposed by industrial countries were largely directed against products such as steel and motor vehicles; thus, they affected other industrial, rather than developing, countries. A major exception to this pattern has occurred through restrictions imposed upon exports by developing countries of clothing and textiles. Exports of these items have been governed by the Multi-Fiber Agreement, negotiated in 1973, under which quantitative limits on trade can be imposed in each defined subcategory for each pair of trading partners. A new agreement, negotiated at the end of 1977 for the period 1978-82, is more restrictive than the old one, and, in addition, it is being applied to many more countries, including those that are not yet major exporters. While citing a notional guideline of 6% annual growth for all exporting countries taken together, it leaves considerable scope for the importing countries to set lower limits through bilateral negotiations."
1978,Improvements in the terms of trade of devel-
1978,Trade improvements in 1977 in developing countries were accounted for by increases in both primary and manufactured exports.
1978,"The percentage increase in import values of goods by the nonoil developing countries was exceeded, for the second straight year, by that of exports. Nonetheless, trade deficits for 1977 totaled $12,700 million. This deficit was more than $3,000 million less than in 1976, and was but half the 1974-75 average. Import growth in 1977 was especially strong, however, in lower-income and lower middle-income countries. Import demand in those countries was stimulated by the fact that imports had been contained in the previous year to reduce heavy trade imbalances recorded in 1974 and 1975."
1978,"Further reductions may be difficult to achieve; data for early 1978 suggest that import expansion may well catch up with export growth, and that a reversal in recent terms of trade improvements may push the trade deficit of the nonoil developing countries higher once again. A fall in beverage prices in 1978—data for early 1978 show a fall in those prices from 1977 levels— would, for instance, have a particularly strong adverse effect on the trade balance of the upper-income and intermediate middle-income developing countries. A modest rise in the aggregate current account deficit is not likely to create widespread difficulties in these countries, however."
1978,"The Bank's overall studies of developing country economies in 1977 point to the fact, therefore, that, on average, recovery from the recession years of 1973-75, begun in 1976, continued, and that prospects for 1978 are likely to be unchanged. But the continued growth of developing country economies is a fragile one, and aggregate figures obscure the fact that many social and economic problems cannot be eliminated by rising commodity prices, reduced current account deficits, and expanding trade."
1978,Increased Trade and the World Economy
1978,"nomic relationships among nations is to stimulate further trade relationships between industrialized and developing countries. The World Bank has always attached great importance to the growth of exports from developing countries, for the experience of the last decade has confirmed that exports can be a dynamic factor in overall growth. Countries that have been successful exporters have seen their economies grow as well. Furthermore, a rising export trend can form the base on which the ability of developing countries to borrow and service debt can rest."
1978,"Liberalization of trade—especially trade of manufactured goods—is only one aspect in the overall issue of trade that is of particular interest to the developing world. For those developing countries that export industrial raw materials, and for those that export tropical beverages and fruits, for instance, the main concern is price stability (a subject that will be discussed early in fiscal 1979 by the Bank, and in September 1978 by the Development Committee); for those that export agricultural raw materials, the foremost problem is competition with man-made fibers and synthetics; for developing countries dependent on the export of temperate zone agricultural products, on the other hand, the major issue is the existence, in industrialized countries, of domestic price support policies that aid domestic production."
1978,"For developing countries exporting manufactures, however, liberalization of trade is a key issue. The number of countries involved in this trade has grown as fast as the international pattern of comparative advantage has changed. A decade ago, there were no more than a half dozen developing nations exporting an appreciable amount of manufactured goods. Today, their number has increased fivefold."
1978,"Against this background, it should be noted that current trade barriers imposed by industrialized countries—even against finished manufactures—are, by historical standards, remarkably low. Thus, export promotion policies by many developing countries, coupled with the lowering of trade barriers, have led to the rapid growth of manufactured exports from developing countries—at rates of around 15% yearly in real terms from the early 1960s to 1976. However, increased exports to industrialized countries with stagnating economies are resulting in a rise in"
1978,"The most important way in which developed countries can currently contribute to trade expansion by developing countries is to refrain from introducing new quantitative import restrictions and to clarify and tighten rules regarding ""safeguard"" or emergency use of such restrictions. Other measures that, in theory, could be taken by industrialized countries would be harder, in practice, to adopt. Though studies indicate that it takes about $20,000 worth of manufactured imports to displace one worker in the developed countries, and that increased exports to developing countries can create many of the jobs that would be lost through increased imports, such shifts do give rise to the need for adjustment assistance to displaced firms and workers in developed countries."
1978,"Even in the absence of further measures taken by developed countries to liberalize trade with developing nations, there are steps that the latter group can take to increase its share of world trade."
1978,"Developing countries frequently discriminate against their own exports through a combination of measures that, for instance, encourage the protection of not-so-infant ""infant"" industries, overvalue exchange rates, and that foster purchases at artificially low prices. An increasing number of developing countries have, however, systematically begun to adjust their exchange rate and trade policies so as to eliminate or reduce a bias against exports. Strong moves towards liberalization have been made recently in countries—Argentina and Chile, in particular —that used to be prime proponents of high protection. It will be more difficult to reduce protective measures in developing countries than in the industrialized world; substantial liberalization would, in the short run, cause serious disruption of employment and to the balance of payments positions of many countries. Considerable adjustment assistance would, therefore, be required—particularly for the poorest countries."
1978,"If developing countries accelerate their export promotion policies and if the industrialized nations refrain from creating new trade barriers, the economic effects for the former group could be considerable. It has been estimated that by 1985, for instance, the value of exported manufactures from the developing countries could rise by as much as $21,000 million, and could grow by some 15%yearly."
1978,"The improvement in the commodity terms of trade over the last year was the most dramatic since 1974. Considering the range of major Eastern African commodity exports (which account for over 70% of total export revenues), world market prices rose an average 18% over the past year (1977), compared with an international inflation rate of some 10%. This favorable development was mainly due to increased prices for agricultural crops, as mineral prices, in general, remained depressed. Benefits accrued, especially, to principal coffee and tea exporters like Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zaire. The prices of beef, groundnuts, sisal, and tobacco all recovered from previous declines, but the price of sugar remained at a low plateau in relation to the extremely high levels of 1974-75, hampering the growth of the Region's major sugar exporters, Mauritius and Swaziland. A drop in the price of cotton particularly hurt Sudan, whose economic and financial situation deteriorated seriously, partly also as a result of lagging exports of other agricultural commodities."
1978,"Considerable progress has been made in improving the terms of trade of the rural sector in several countries, which, along with investments designed to support agricultural producers, has provided more incentives and income to the rural population. This improved situation has resulted partly from movements in world market prices, but, more importantly, from basic policy changes designed to redress sectoral imbalances within member countries. Furthermore, some governments have also begun to review-how public services might best meet the basic needs of people. The bill for these services will be a rapidly growing one, because of sharp increases in population."
1978,"25% in volume and by an additional 4% in price from their levels of a year ago. The government reacted by curtailing budgeted public development expenditures and by resorting, for the first time, to borrowing (SI,000 million) in the Eurodollar market so that priority investment projects might continue. At the same time, harvests of food crops were below normal, adding to food imports; these increased imports helped boost the rate of domestic price inflation to about 30%. In addition, Nigeria's terms of trade worsened appreciably. Though the manufacturing and the services sectors continued to expand, their combined gains hardly outweighed the declines registered elsewhere in the economy; on balance, therefore, per capita national income probably dropped somewhat. The loss in real income appears to be more pronounced for the urban population, whose wages and salaries remained substantially fixed, than for farmers, who benefited from sizable increases in producer prices, which, in some cases, exceeded the inflation rate."
1978,"A two-pronged attack on Upper Volta's urban problems was launched during fiscal 1978 in the form of an $8.2 million IDA credit to help finance an urban development project and a $4 million IDA credit to help finance a project for artisanal and small and medium-scale enterprise development. These projects were designed to ameliorate both the living and employment conditions of the most disadvantaged urban dwellers. The urban project includes basic infrastructure improvement loans, and funds for provision of community facilities and social services. More than 100,000 people living in Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso are expected to benefit from the urban upgrading, sites and services, and water supply distribution components of the project. Job creation will be stimulated by the $4 million credit, which will also expand training opportunities to urban artisans, as well as provide training in the construction trade, with the trainees actually constructing the community centers to be financed under the urban project. Some 750 jobs are to be created in the modern sector, and about 1,500 jobs may be created in the traditional sector as a result of the project."
1978,"Indonesia and Malaysia, the two important oil producers within the Region, have improved their terms of trade since fiscal 1973. Their traditional exports (rubber, timber, and tin) suffered temporarily, however, from low demand and lower prices in 1974 and 1975. Indonesia has also been affected by the need to meet the debt obligations of Pertamina, the state oil company. But, by fiscal year 1977, both countries were recovering; the earlier gains in their terms of trade were restored, and foreign exchange reserves increased. In Indonesia, reserves reached a level, at the end of 1977, that amounted to about four months of imports. The country's economy grew an estimated 6.5% in 1977, somewhat lower than in 1976. mainly because of lagging food production, particularly rice, but the 1977 growth rate corresponded to the average for the 1974-77 period. In Malaysia, a recent oil producer, and one which is expected to become an exporter of natural gas by the early 1980s, current account surpluses and foreign exchange reserves increased to very comfortable levels by the end of 1977. Growth in gross national product (GNP) was 8% in 1977, only slightly below the rate achieved in 1976."
1978,"The Philippines and Thailand, whose exports are quite different from those of Indonesia and Malaysia, experienced fluctuations in their non-oil commodity terms of trade virtually opposite to those experienced by the latter two countries. During the recession years of 1974 and 1975, the Philippines and Thailand were shielded from the effects of higher petroleum prices by con-"
1978,"Its export volume increased by 18% in 1977, following a large increase in 1976. and its terms of trade improved by 6%. The large balance of payments deficits of 1974 and 1975 were eliminated, and a small surplus was achieved in 1977. By the end of 1977, gross foreign exchange reserves had increased to a level equal to about four months of imports. Korea's GNP growth rate exceeded 10% in 1977, having risen to 15% in 1976 from 8% per year in the previous two recession years."
1978,"Industrial development is being emphasized by most countries within the Region, and the Bank is supporting these efforts through direct loans or through lending extended by financial intermediaries. In Indonesia, industrial investment has, so far, been mainly for large, capital-intensive projects, but the government now recognizes that the small-scale enterprise sector has an important role to play in providing productive employment at a low cost per worker. Small-scale enterprises range from some relatively modern firms in manufacturing, construction, and transport to large numbers of traditional artisans and small traders, with the latter accounting for a major proportion of the total number. Limited access to institutional credit has been one of the major constraints to the growth and modernization of many small-scale enterprises. In 1974, the Government of Indonesia initiated a credit program to provide investment and working capital to small-scale"
1978,Liberalization of Trade
1978,"At a time when the Region has been facing serious external and internal imbalances and at a time when the more industrialized countries of the world are seriously and openly considering a return to some forms of protectionism, a number of countries in the Latin America and the Caribbean area have substantially liberalized their trade policies. Since 1974, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, and Uruguay have implemented trade liberalization programs that have resulted in substantial reductions in across-the-board tariff levels. Equally important programs for the reduction of quantitative import restrictions have also been implemented. Moreover, most of the countries of the area have maintained, and are operating on, a flexible exchange rate system. Although there have been, and are, some exceptions, exchange rate movements since 1974 show that the countries have responded fairly well to price movements and current account developments."
1978,"The recent marked improvements in the Region's external balances, the modest rise in economic activity (against a backdrop of sluggish economic performance by the industrialized countries), the progress in reducing inflation, and the continuation of realistic trade and exchange rate policies constitute a considerable economic achievement. However, to do so, the nonoil developing countries of the Region have been obliged to apply restrictive domestic policies that have limited the growth of consumption and, in some cases, employment and investment levels, as well. The fact that most of the Region's countries are giving increasing attention to improving the distribution of the benefits of growth has made the imposition of restrictive policies particularly painful."
1978,"The fact that the Latin America and the Caribbean Region has demonstrated an increasing ability to increment and diversify its exports and that its access to medium-term and long-term capital continues to expand is of significance not only to the Region, but to the developed world. The resulting higher levels of investments and economic activity in the Region create a multiplier effect on world trade and output—via the impact of the Region's increasing imports—that is not insignificant. The relative importance of the many semi-industrialized, middle-income economies in the Region suggests that the potential for further expansion of trade and capital flows is great."
1978,"As the UN system moves toward the beginning of the Third UN Development Decade, the Bank pursued interagency exchanges in several key areas of long-range economic development. Thus, the Bank participated in the Ad Hoc Interagency Working Group on the World Employment Conference to assess what is being done as a follow-up to the Conference's resolutions concerning a basic needs strategy; it is taking an active role in the ACC (Administrative Committee on Coordination) Task Force on Long-term Development Objectives. It participated in the UN system's preparations for several global conferences: the UN Conference on Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries, the Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development, and the Conference on Science and Technology. The Bank was represented in a number of intergovernmental meetings organized by the UN Conference on Trade and Development. It was also represented at the UN Conference on Desertification, held in Kenya, as well as at the Tenth World Energy Conference, held in Turkey."
1978,"tant natural resources and resource-based commodities. One research project comprises a number of subprojects, including the construction of a model of world energy economy; regional and global models of trade flows and of investment planning in the bauxite/aluminum industries; and research on the dynamics of commodity markets."
1978,"Considerable research in the Bank in the field of international trade has been prompted by the importance of trade prospects in the economies of the developing world. For example, a major study under way is designed to undertake a rigorous analysis of the subject through a cross-section investigation of the production of major export commodities and a time-series analysis of the effects of export promotion measures. It will evaluate the export promotion efforts of four developing countries: Brazil, the Republic of China, Greece, and Pakistan. The results will be used to formulate recommendations on the scope and methods of export promotion in developing countries."
1978,"The research program at the Bank has now completed one cycle in the sense that several projects, initiated at the start of the program, are now completed, or are close to completion. It was decided that this would be an opportune moment to review the program to assist the management of the Bank in determining the size and nature of the research program over the next cycle. To this end, a general panel of eminent individuals has been established. This panel will be assisted by seven panels, each of which is to review a specialized area of research. Two panels have already reported, the External Advisory Panel on Population and the Research Advisory Panel on Income Distribution and Employment. Five new ones have been planned to cover the following areas of research: Industrial Development and Trade, Education, Public Utilities, Transport, and Agriculture and Rural Development. The review is expected to be completed near the end of fiscal year 1979."
1978,"The Bank does not trade in the currencies of its member countries for its account. Under present policies, adjustments arising from the translation of currencies to US dollar equivalents would not now, or in the future, result in realized gains or losses such as would result from the actual conversion of currencies into US dollars."
1978,"On June 30, 1977, the Bank made its first loan —of $150 million, to India for the development of the Bombay High offshore field—for oil and gas exploitation. Earlier in the same month, governments represented at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation (CIEC) invited the Bank to expand its participation in developing countries, particularly in energy-importing developing countries, in order to assess the capital availabilities for investment in energy exploration and development. The Conference also called on the Bank to act as a catalyst to induce additional flows of capital into energy development. Later in the same year, a new Petroleum Projects Division was set up within the Bank's Energy, Water, and Telecommunications Department in order to expedite better the requests of member governments for assistance in the energy sector. During fiscal 1978, the Bank sent missions to more than a dozen developing countries to identify and prepare projects aimed at oil and gas production."
1978,"occurred or have been strengthened. There was confirmation of commercially exploitable petroleum resources in Chad and Ivory Coast, and the prospect of such in Ghana; active exploration continued in four or five other countries. Cameroon is a step further along, and recorded its first exports of indigenous crude oil in February 1978. Niger continued to enjoy rising earnings from exports of uranium concentrate. Even more significant perhaps, because it reflects governments' conscious efforts to strengthen the economy of the Region as a whole, further progress was made towards regional economic cooperation. The 16-member Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)'"" became operational in July 1977, when both the Secretariat in Lagos and the Fund for Cooperation, Compensation, and Development in Lome opened their doors for business. The Bank has established contacts with these institutions, as it has done before with other regional organizations in Western Africa, such as the West African Development Bank (BOAD), with a view to cooperation and coordination of activities. In addition, the six-member francophone West African Economic Community (CEAO)(2) created a new Solidarity Fund, in whose design and institution the Bank provided technical assistance. The Fund is to aid particularly its less developed member countries by guaranteeing loans, giving loans and subsidies, and financing studies for high-priority development projects."
1978,"Major sources of co-financing for projects were: the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan ($224 million), the US Agency for International Development ($74.7 million), the Saudi Fund (at least $70 million), the Abu Dhabi Fund (at least $25 million), the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (at least $ 14.5 million), and the OPEC Special Fund ($10.25 million)."
1978,"Formal consultations were held during the year with France's Ministry of Cooperation and the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique, with the Ministry of Economic Cooperation of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau, the Japanese aid agencies (the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan and the Export-Import Bank of Japan), and the United Kingdom's Ministry of Overseas Development to review questions of common interest and to discuss country and project matters as well as possibilities for co-financing. Regular contacts were also maintained with the Abu Dhabi Fund for Arab Economic Development, the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, BADEA, the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, the Islamic Development Bank, the Saudi Fund for Development, and the Venezuelan Investment Fund, as well as with financing agencies in the OECD countries, to determine possibilities for co-financing of specific projects. In addition, discussions took place with representatives of the newly organized IFAD to explore avenues for cooperation between the Bank and that organization. Details of the agreement reached between the Bank and IFAD may be found in the next section. ""Interagency Cooperation,"" of this Annual Report."
1978,"Extensive, as always, were the Bank's contacts with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and Bank participation in the work of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD on bilateral aid programs, projections of aid and its terms and purposes, and external debt. Consulta-"
1950,"The demand for raw materials has increased the foreign-exchange earnings of many of the Bank's member countries. These increased earnings, combined with the disappearance of dollar deficits in many countries, have generally strengthened the underdeveloped countries in their ability to service foreign debts. At the same time, the increase in the prices of raw materials has worsened the terms of trade of many industrialized countries and thereby increased the strain on their resources."
1950,"In earlier years the Bank's lending operations were almost exclusively confined to loans in United States dollars, since the United States was virtually the only country whose economy could afford a net outflow of capital and resources. The appraisal of the ability of the Bank's borrowers to carry increased debt had to be based on the prospects of these countries to service dollar loans — either by earning dollars in direct trade with the dollar area or by converting the necessary amounts from other currencies into dollars. During the past year the direct and indirect dollar earnings of many countries have improved; but there are still a number of countries that cannot service loans in dollars to the extent they can in other currencies. At the same time, the expansion of production and income in many of the Western European countries has created a reasonable expectation that these countries would find it possible to devote resources on an increasing scale to supply some part of the development needs of underdeveloped countries on long-term credit. The impact of the rearmament program on rhe economies of Western Europe has, however, for the time being, raised new difficulties. The Bank wishes to expand its loan operations in non-dollar currencies insofar as European member countries are able to release 18% funds and to"
1950,"During the fiscal year the Bank has obtained currencies other than United States dollars both through releases of 18% funds and through borrowing operations. The currencies thus made available include mainly Canadian dollars and European currencies. The interchangeability of a portion of the funds obtained in Europe within the framework of the European Payments Union enables the Bank to use them to finance purchases in most of the countries of Western Europe. Loans of funds in currencies other than United States dollars should clearly be to the advantage of those borrowers who, because of the pattern of their foreign trade and international payments, find it easier to discharge a non-dollar debt than one in dollars. But such loans may have more far-reaching consequences. To the extent that they contribute to the acceleration of economic progress in underdeveloped countries, they may eventually strengthen the ability of these countries to assume debts in all currencies, including United States dollars. In addition, in view of expanded industrial production in Western Europe and limitations on the availability of many types of equipment in the United States, it is quite possible that those countries which can afford to incur dollar indebtedness will increasingly use borrowed dollars for purchases in non-dollar areas."
1950,"The Bank's $1.5 million telecommunications loan will finance the import of equipment needed for the expansion and improvement of three different communications systems: the local telephone service at Addis Ababa; an interurban system; and an international radio-telephone and radio-telegraph service. In 1950, there were less than 2,000 telephones in Ethiopia to serve a population estimated officially at 15 million persons, and fewer than 100 communities in the country could be reached by telephone or telegraph. Successful completion and operation of the projects contemplated under the Bank's loan would enable producers to get quicker and wider knowledge of market conditions, would help shippers and traders to keep track of goods moving on the roads, and would give the Government additional channels for communicating both with outlying centers of population and with other countries. The Government intends to establish a new Telecommunication Authority to carry out the project and to train Ethiopian personnel, and will select suitable management for the Authority in consultation with the Bank."
1950,"Ethiopia's current balance of payments account has been approximately in equilibrium since the end of World War II. The value of exports has been well maintained; a market for hides and skins is well established in the United States and the present high price of coffee has greatly increased the income from the coffee crop, while the Government is making efforts to expand its export trade in other commodities."
1950,"During the fiscal year, certain developments in the Indian economy were more favorable than in previous years. India built up a current balance of payments surplus, including substantial net dollar earnings. Foreign-exchange assets increased, in contrast to the steady decline prior to devaluation in 1949. Many of the difficulties arising from the protracted trade deadlock with Pakistan have been dispelled by the trade settlement between the two countries early in 1951. Greater availability of essential supplies from Pakistan, especially raw jute, should strengthen India's export position. However, a normal relationship between the two countries cannot be expected until a solution of the major political issues which exist between them has been found. In the year 1951 as a whole the Indian balance of payments position may be affected by heavy import requirements, particularly of grain needed to make up the deficiencies caused by wide-spread crop failures in 1950. The United States Government has authorized a long-term loan of $190 million to finance part of the grain-import requirements."
1950,"by the increased world demand and high prices for her exports. Early in 1951 the virtual trade deadlock with India was broken by the conclusion of a new trade agreement. However, the major political issues which exist between the two countries still hamper the establishment of normal relations. In the 1950-51 financial year Pakistan reached an over-all balance in its budgetary position and since September 1950 has substantially increased its foreign assets through a current balance of payments surplus. Economic development in Pakistan is already going forward and the general lines of emphasis appear well conceived."
1950,"tin, which had lagged since the war, recovered to nearly the prewar average. Thailand achieved large trade and balance of payments surpluses with both the hard and soft-currency areas, and its gold and foreign-exchange teserves, which had been rising since 1948, reached a new high. The internal price level has remained relatively stable."
1950,"Unfortunately, these achievements have not brought Denmark the benefits which were hoped for two and a half years ago. The terms of trade deteriorated seriously after the currency devaluation of 1949. This development has been further accentuated since the outbreak of war in Korea. Since September 1949, the prices of Denmark's imports have risen by more than 60%. The prices of her exports, on the other hand, have increased only a few per cent, in part because exports to the United Kingdom are largely governed by long-term bulk-purchase contracts. The significance of the deterioration in the terms of trade for the Danish economy is illustrated by the fact that, but for these price changes, Denmark would have achieved a small surplus on her balance of payments account for 1950 instead of a deficit equivalent to about $100 million. Although exports to the dollar area have risen considerably, Denmark still faces a seri-"
1950,"arations deliveries, due to end in Septembet 1952, are already tapering off. Finland's payments position, both with tegard to dollars and other currencies, is satisfactory but is dependent upon a continuation of the present highly favorable terms of trade. Inflation — caused chiefly by a high level of investment and the heavy burden of reparations, and aggravated by rising money incomes of both fanners and workers — remains the most urgent economic problem. During the past year inflation has been given additional impetus by the rise in prices of imported raw materials. However, since January 1951 a stronger anti-inflationary policy has been adopted."
1950,"Production in France has geared itself to a higher level of industrial activity than it had reached at the outbreak of war in Korea. However, the growing burden of rearmament, shortages and highet prices of raw materials, the budgetary deficit, and the inflationary rise in domestic prices remain serious problems. The external financial position continued to improve in 1950. The current account of the balance of payments of the franc area showed a deficit equivalent to $238 million; the dollar deficit was $419 million, but there was a substantial surplus with other continental European countries. In the first half of 1951, for metropolitan France only, the deficit in dollar trade was substantially lower than in the corresponding period of 1950- However, the position in trade with other areas, notably Europe, was less favorable so that the over-all trade deficit with foreign countries was approximately the same."
1950,"The output of goods and services in the Netherlands has continued to increase, making possible a further slight rise in real per capita income in 1950. The level of domestic consumption continued to decline somewhat, allowing a higher rate of investment, largely in increased inventories. Considerable inflationary pressures developed, generated by a combination of internal credit expansion and the rise of prices in world markets. Owing to sustained high tax receipts the Treasury cash position developed favorably through 1950 but due to tightening of the market for Treasury securities, the cash position has considerably deteriorated during the first half of 1951. The balance of payments has suffered a sharp setback. The deficit on current account climbed from roughly the equivalent of $74 million in 1949 to $237 million in 1950 because of deterioration in the terms of trade and increased imports for inventory accumulations. The ratio of exports to imports fell from 72% in 1949 to 68% in 1950. The deficit with the dollar area, however, continued to decrease from $191 million in 1949 to $107 million in 1950."
1950,"Brazil's economic situation improved during the past year. Both agricultural and industrial production increased. Development of power, transportation facilities and domestic refining of imported liquid fuels was accelerated and heavy industry, an outgrowth of rising domestic production of steel, expanded. The world price of coffee continued high, and following the outbreak of hostilities in Korea, there was an increase in mosr other export prices and an urgenr demand from abroad for greater production of strategic minerals. For the year 1950, foreign trade showed an over-all surplus of about $250 million compared with a deficit of around $25 million in 1949. The improvement was largely in dollars; it permitted the liquidation of former arrears on dollar remittances and the accumulation of substantial net dollar holdings at the end of the first quarter of 1951. Concurrently, by purchases from the International Monetary Fund and by special arrangements with the Bank of England, accumulated arrears in sterling were reduced. The improved dollar position and the rise in world food and raw-material prices permitted a considerable relaxation both of export licensing and of quantitative import restrictions which were introduced in 1948, and lessened the resort to barter trade as a means of moving certain exports. Accelerated foreign debt amortization, particularly"
1950,"Mexico today is enjoying highly prosperous conditions. The expansion of both agricultural and industrial production which followed the stabilization of the peso in 1949, has now received the further stimulus of the urgent world demand for raw materials. The terms of trade have accordingly been moving in Mexico's favor; imports have expanded. Net receipts from tourism, an increasingly important source of Mexico's earnings of foreign exchange, rose steadily throughout 1950. In addition, the exchange reserves of the country have been considerably augmented through the inflow of short-term capital from abroad."
1950,"The agricultural loan will provide the foreign exchange required for the purchase and importation of agricultural machinery and spare parts. The machinery, which will range from small tractors to heavy land-clearing equipment, will be imported through normal channels of trade and will be sold to farmers who will have received credits from the Banco Nacional. A training program is being undertaken and arrangements are being made to provide facilities for the repair and maintenance of the equipment."
1950,"The French Government authorized the listing on the Paris Bourse of the Bank's twenty-five year 3% bonds due 1972 and the twenty-five year bonds of 1951 due 1976. French foreign-exchange regulations permit residents of France to purchase, in the United States, International Bank bonds with dollars acquired through the sale in the United States of other securities. The Bank's bonds so acquired are officially traded on the Paris Bourse and may be purchased directly against French francs."
1951,"Transportation: The less developed countries need basic transportation facilities, to quicken internal and international trade and to provide new incentives for production. Without ready access to markets, farmers in many countries will continue to grow only what they need for their own consumption; without adequate roads and railroads to reach potential customers, industry will not flourish; and raw materials beyond the reach of transportation will lie idle. The Bank's lending for transportation amounts to $179 million. It includes the financing of highway construction (in Colombia, Ethiopia and Nicaragua), railway rehabilitation (in Australia, Brazil, India, Pakistan, Thailand and the Union of South Africa), and port development (in Peru, South Africa, Thailand and Turkey)."
1951,"Because of the present and probable future pattern of its foreign trade, Yugoslavia is able to service foreign indebtedness in Western European currencies with less difficulty than in dollars. The Bank therefore obtained permission from Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom to use parts of their capital subscriptions for this loan. Purchases are being made in Germany and in the United States and Canada as well as in the Western European coun-"
1979,"Trade liberalization in developing countries is, therefore, progressing. Recent actions by several developing country governments are indicative of this trend. Measures have included: (a) the Indian government's continuation of a liberalized import policy for capital goods, and the reduction of import duties on a number of consumer items; (b) a decision by Brazil to reduce the 100% ad valorem deposits on imports and the 100% tax rebates on exports by 5 % each quarter until they are phased out altogether; (c) the customs tariff reductions by Argentina that are also intended to stabilize internal prices; (d) an easing of regulations for foreign banks by the Republic of China; and (e) a three-year import liberalization program in the Republic of Korea, designed to bring 90% of import items under automatic approval."

1979,"Twenty percent ($3,181 million) of all international bonds was raised by borrowers from developing countries. Twenty-five developing countries tapped the market, the largest amounts being raised by borrowers from Algeria ($558 million), Brazil (S541 million), Venezuela ($382 million), and Mexico ($346 million). During 1977, the most active borrowers were from Mexico ($757 million), Brazil ($604 million), Algeria ($215 million), and Spain ($190 million). Borrowers from eight countries raised funds for the first time in the international market during 1978: Kuwait (S62 million), Ecuador (S62 million), Indonesia ($54 million), Chile ($50 million), El Salvador ($25 million), Thailand ($25 million), the Republic of China (S20 million), and Costa Rica ($20 million)."
1979,"Seventy-four percent ($863 million) of the US dollar-denominated bonds issued by borrowers from developing countries were floating rate notes. As with borrowers from industrialized countries, most developing country borrowers were deposit money banks. Borrowers from four developing countries that raised funds for the first time in the international market in 1978 issued floating rate notes: Kuwait ($25 million), the Republic of China ($20 million), Costa Rica ($20 million), and El Salvador ($25 million). Original maturities on floating rate notes were primarily for five to seven years. Spreads varied, ranging from 0.25% to 1.25% over the six-month LIBOR."
1979,"The centrally planned countries and organizations borrowed $5,058 million during the first half of 1979, or almost twice the amount they borrowed during 1978. This increase is accounted for by the debut of the People's Republic of China in the Eurocurrency credit market. During the first six months of 1979, the People's Republic of China raised $3,325 million, or 66% of the total amount borrowed by this group of countries."
1979,"East Asia and Pacific—China (Republic of), Fiji, Indonesia, Korea (Republic of), Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand."
1979,"Levels of development already achieved, as well as domestic policies pursued, were clearly instrumental in the developing countries' growth. For the least developed countries, highly dependent as they are on one or two primary products, trends in prices and volume of trade were determinants of export growth, and played an important role in overall economic performance. For countries with more advanced and diversified economies, sound domestic policies and economic management led to high domestic investment, and generally, to a healthy export performance. This latter group of countries was able to build up reserves and borrow from private financial markets, thus adding to the external resources made available by high trade growth. If major economic and political upheavals can be avoided in the future, such conditions might be able to be created among a wider grouping of developing countries."
1979,"—the economic difficulties of the industrialized countries, the instability of exchange rates, and the prevailing atmosphere of uncertainty about the growth of international trade and the future movements of capital suggest that it will be more difficult for the developing countries to expand their economies in the coming decade than it has been in the past 25 years; and that"
1979,Developments in International Trade
1979,"According to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) staff estimates, the volume of international trade increased by about 5% in 1978, up slightly from the 4% average annual rate for the period, 1973-77. The unit value of world trade, as measured in US dollars, was estimated to have risen by 9% for the second straight year in 1978."
1979,staff estimates that this effect contributed to roughly one-half of the increase in dollar unit value of world trade; effective price trends (both for primary and manufactured commodities) were thus far weaker in 1978 than in 1977.
1979,"The barter terms of trade for those developing countries that are still net importers of manufactures and net exporters of primary commodities deteriorated in 1978, but the effects were diverse within this group. Countries exporting tropical beverage products, particularly coffee, were the hardest hit, although it should be noted that their prices remained above 1976 levels in real terms. Countries exporting some food products (oil and oilseeds, beef, wheat, maize), agricultural raw materials (including cotton, rubber, and timber), and metals (particularly copper, lead, zinc, and the minor metals) have benefited from an upturn in prices that began in 1978 and continued strongly into 1979."
1979,"The experience of countries exporting manufactures has also been diverse, reflecting the product composition of their imports and exports. In general, they probably benefited from improved terms of trade during 1978; more recently, however, their terms of trade have begun to decline."
1979,"The export growth of developing countries was facilitated by the industrialized countries' trade liberalization policies. By the completion, in the early 1970s, of the tariff reductions mandated by the Kennedy Round of multilateral trade negotiations, the trade regimes of the industrialized countries had become less restrictive than at any time since before 1914. Some restrictions survived, however, both in the form of relatively high tariffs and as nontariff barriers against the import of agricultural products, some primary processed products, textiles, clothing, and footwear. On the other hand, many developing countries, particularly the least developed, were given privileged access to industrialized country markets under the General Preference Scheme."
1979,"The recent conclusion, after five years of negotiation, of the Tokyo Round of multilateral trade negotiations under GATT auspices could—despite its imperfections—have the effect of reducing, further, barriers against developing country exports. The agreement is expected to result in average tariff cuts of 35% to 38% over an eight-year period, although tariffs on imports from developing countries are expected to decline by only 25%, or some 10 to 13 points less than the average tariff reduction. But the most encouraging results of the Tokyo Round are to be found in the area of nontariff barriers to trade. This achievement has been accomplished by a strengthening of GATT codes, including important changes"
1979,"with respect to codes covering customs valuation, government procurement practices, export subsidies, countervailing duties, and product standards. In addition, the agreement broadens the code regulating safeguard actions to attempt to bring them within the ambit of GATT. This issue has been left somewhat open, and it has been pointed out that without an active interest by developing and industrialized countries, the codes could provide legal cover for restrictive action. But, as the President of the World Bank pointed out in Manila, in May 1979, the most important point about the trade agreements could well lie in the environment and the spirit in which those agreements are implemented. If implemented in a positive way, the agreements could be an important step against the rise of protectionism, and the code revisions could well help stimulate developing country exports."
1979,"The developing countries' own restrictions on trade, in the form of exchange controls and tariff and nontariff barriers, are considerably tighter than those of the industrialized countries. It was for this reason that the expansion of developing country exports, particularly of manufactures, was directed to industrialized countries in the 1960s and early 1970s. The rate of growth of trade among developing countries began to rise only after 1973, when the markets of the petroleum-exporting countries opened up. This trade still makes up only about 20% of total developing country exports, with petroleum exports accounting for a major share. About 30% of developing country exports of manufactures and services are to other developing countries, with the oil-exporting countries providing major markets. As the centrally planned economies take only about 6% of these exports, the largest markets remain in industrialized countries. The developing countries, because of their relatively strong economic performance in the 1970s, have become more important markets for the industrialized countries, accounting for more than 25% of their total exports."
1979,"Trade liberalization in developing countries is, therefore, progressing. Recent actions by several developing country governments are indicative of this trend. Measures have included: (a) the Indian government's continuation of a liberalized import policy for capital goods, and the reduction of import duties on a number of consumer items; (b) a decision by Brazil to reduce the 100% ad valorem deposits on imports and the 100% tax rebates on exports by 5 % each quarter until they are phased out altogether; (c) the customs tariff reductions by Argentina that are also intended to stabilize internal prices; (d) an easing of regulations for foreign banks by the Republic of China; and (e) a three-year import liberalization program in the Republic of Korea, designed to bring 90% of import items under automatic approval."
1979,"If general economic conditions do not deteriorate so that the industrialized countries can not only continue to hold the line against protectionist pressures, but also liberalize trade further in the wake of the Tokyo Round, and if the developing countries continue to move along the path toward trade liberalization, the outlook for increased trade would be promising."
1979,"The earliest Bank-assisted projects for serviced sites were designed to reach not far below the median level of family incomes. Compared with conventional public housing programs, that was already an achievement. Bank-assisted projects have since been refined and adapted to reach urban families at much lower income levels, often excluding only the poorest 10% to 20%c of the population. The buildup of technical design expertise— not only among Bank staff but among consultants and local authorities as a result of Bank initiatives—has been a principal factor in this process. New methodologies and analytical tools have been developed, for example, to test trade-offs between alternate design features. Because market values of project sites often are well in excess of the costs, it has been possible to charge more for commercial plots and the plots allotted to higher-income families in the target group and to charge poor families correspondingly less than the share of the costs indicated by the plot size."
1979,"Increases in agriculture production in the Region were offset, however, by major, adverse movements in the international commodity terms of trade. Copper exports, which account for nearly a third of regional exports in dollar terms, recovered somewhat in value, but the 1978 price level still remained far below the long-term average. Nor did tropical beverages, which constitute 12% of regional exports, fare well. Their prices fell sharply from the extraordinary peak reached in 1977. While the financial pressures accentuated by the economic turbulence of the period, 197374, had been relieved, in several countries, by the upswing in coffee and tea prices during 1976 and 1977, the sharp decline in beverage prices during 1978 (31% for coffee and 18% for tea) revealed, once again, the structural"
1979,"weakness in government finances and the balance of payments. In 1978, the composite price index of Eastern Africa's exports declined by 5% (the fall in beverages was partially offset by the rise in beef, groundnut, sisal, and tobacco prices); commodity terms of trade deteriorated by 11%; and the persistent rise in import prices continued into 1979."
1979,"Adverse external conditions led to a decline in foreign exchange reserves in most countries, and several of them ended 1978 with a negative net foreign asset position. The decline in foreign exchange reserves prompted a number of governments to borrow in the Eurodollar market at interest rates well over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and with maturities of only five to seven years. Several others are reported to be in advanced stages of negotiating similar loans. While the recourse to commercial bank credit can inject quickly much needed funds into an economy, the attendant medium-term debt-servicing requirements could prove to be worrisome in some cases. Several countries have, in addition, accumulated large arrears in trade and other payments. A general, regionwide effort was made in fiscal 1979 to sustain the growth in imports by drawing down reserves, borrowing abroad, and accumulating arrears; in several cases, however, the effort proved futile. In"
1979,"some countries, imports in 1978 declined in real terms; in others, only little growth was registered. Given the fact that many countries depend heavily on foreign trade taxes as a source of public revenues, the sluggishness of imports, combined with declines in export prices, had the effect of reducing the tax base. Though several governments both slowed the pace of development and acted to reduce recurrent expenditures, budgetary deficits continued to be widespread. Most countries of the Region experienced double-digit inflation."
1979,"These difficulties are expected to persist for some time. While prices of some primary exports are likely to rise soon (e.g., copper and sugar), recovery is not yet in sight in other cases, such as for tropical beverages. Furthermore, the rise in the price of imported oil and manufactured goods is not likely to be reversed in the short run. Neither is it likely that importing countries will quickly dismantle protective barriers impeding exports from the Region. The Region's shortage of foreign exchange has not been caused solely by adverse movements in its terms of trade; it is also due to persistent structural problems and continuing weaknesses in economic management, both of which have made diversification in production and exports difficult to achieve. In some cases, such as in Sudan and Somalia,"
1979,"A $5 million IDA credit to help finance a highway project in the Comoros marks the Bank's first lending operation in that island country, which gained independence only in 1975, and which became a member of the Bank in December 1976 and IDA in December 1977. This operation also afforded other external agencies—the African Development Fund and the OPEC Special Fund, which were co-financers of the project—the opportunity to provide financial assistance to the Comoros. Improvement of the country's transport infrastructure is crucial to the Comoros' socioeconomic development—ports to facilitate foreign trade, and highways to help develop the island's agricultural sector. Many villages are not linked to the main road system or are, at best, connected to it by tracks that only four-wheel drive vehicles can negotiate. The project has three main objectives: institution building through a program of technical assistance and training of local staff, which is expected to improve the performance of the national road administration; a road maintenance and improvement program that will help finance the improvement, to all-weather standards, of about 120 kilometers of tracks and will set up one resealing and two road patching units; and the expansion of the main road network into one of the country's most densely populated and underdeveloped areas—but one with considerable agricultural potential. In addition, studies related to a second highway project and a possible integrated rural development project located in an area served by the present IDA-supported road project will be undertaken."
1979,"In fiscal 1979, the economic performance of the Bank's major East Asian borrowers— Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand—continued to build on its impressive record of the last 15 years. Per capita gross national product (GNP) growth rates were again substantially higher than the average for all developing countries. According to the main indicators of welfare, past GNP growth has been accompanied by broad advances in the satisfaction of basic needs in health, nutrition, education, and other services. This record of economic and social progress can be attributed to a number of factors: political stability, generally strong commitment to development, a large increase in investment levels, high priority given to the agriculture and export sectors, an unprece-dentedly rapid increase in international trade"
1979,"has concentrated on the relationships between economic growth, employment, and poverty. Especially in countries where land resources are scarce, it appears that a direct attack on poverty must be embedded in a general development strategy aimed at a rapid increase in employment opportunities. In such a strategy, available labor can initially be more fully utilized, thus increasing household incomes; this has already occurred in most of the Region's countries. Eventually, as the labor market tightens, the least productive activities are gradually eliminated, and the real wage rate is forced up; generally, this second stage has not yet been reached. As a consequence, while rapid overall economic expansion has had a significant impact on the economic position of the underprivileged in the Region, the distribution of the benefits of growth has remained generally unequal. Such unequal distribution is also occurring between regions within a number of countries, where, most notably, areas dependent on rainfed agriculture often lag behind. This situation has led the Bank to examine regional issues in more depth. Furthermore, now that the necessary financial and economic adjustments to the large year-to-year international economic fluctuations induced by the structural increase in oil prices and the international recession have been made, and the structural shifts in terms of trade have manifested themselves more clearly, it has become possible to reassess the capital requirements of the major East Asian countries as they relate to the need for a rapid expansion in employment and incomes."
1979,"Thailand, the Philippines is likely to face substantial current account deficits over the coming years as a result of a structural terms of trade loss. Since the country already has a substantial external debt, careful balance of payments management will continue to be essential to support its export-oriented and employment-oriented strategy, especially in manufacturing."
1979,"The country's foremost economic challenges are: to reduce high unemployment, to lessen the dependence upon tree crop exports, and to restore long-term economic growth. To help achieve these goals, the government intends to increase investments significantly during the next five years. Public sector investment is to center around three major development schemes: the accelerated implementation of the Mahaweli Ganga development program/2' aimed at harnessing the island's substantial irrigation and power potential; the establishment of a free-trade zone for industry; and a major new housing and urban development program."
1979,"a larger share of output and trade, aggregate output reached $464,000 million and investment expenditures reached $99,000 million in 1978. Imports and exports of $63,800 million and $58,900 million, respectively, resulted in a resource gap of $4,900 million in 1978, compared with $2,300 million the previous year. Principally because of interest payments on external debt, the current account deficit in the balance of payments reached $14,100 million for the year, well above the $9,600 million level recorded in 1977. Interest and other factor service payments thus accounted for a larger part of the current account deficit than did the resource gap. While this 1978 deficit represents a new high in absolute terms, it is no more than 3% of the Region's GDP; by contrast, the smaller nominal current account deficit of $13,800 million in 1975 was 4.1% of that year's GDP."
1979,"The larger current account deficit in 1978 was also partly the result of both a regional deterioration in the terms of trade and the consequence of higher interest rates on an increasing volume of debt. The fall in coffee prices had a major effect upon the Region's export earnings; this decline represented, however, a return towards more normal long-term prices following the extraordinary levels reached in 1977. Prices for some other important commodities, such as beef and copper, improved, although relatively poor sugar prices continued to create problems for several countries. Price increases and decreases roughly offset each other, and export prices were, on the average, almost unchanged from 1977. As import prices rose by over 6%, the Region's terms of trade deteriorated by about this same amount."

Technical assistance and training will be provided to the Roads Branch, as well as the procurement of maintenance equipment and workshop equipment and tools. Consumers, traders, and producers—including small farmers—will benefit from the project. Total cost: $15.1 million."
1979,"In the trade area, cooperation with the UNCTAD/GATT International Trade Centre (ITC) on export projects and measures to increase exports in individual countries and in selected trade regions stepped up sharply. An export promotion project was initiated in Portugal with joint Bank-ITC financing. The Bank organized an interagency meeting on the effects of inflation and exchange rate fluctuations on trade analyses and on the establishment of a common unit in international price series and index deflators for export earnings and trade growth. It consulted with GATT regarding a system being established at the Bank for the continuous monitoring of trends in protectionism."
1979,"A Bank delegation participated in the Fifth UN Conference on Trade and Development, which was addressed by the President of the Bank. The Bank was represented at the International Conference on Primary Health Care at Alma Ata (USSR), sponsored by WHO and UNICEF, and contributed to the preparatory work of the UN Conferences on Science and Technology for Development and on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development. The Bank provided the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) with information on its techniques of project appraisal, assistance in the recruitment of experts, and access to relevant data for the preparation of the UN Transport and Communications Decade in Africa. As its contribution to the International Year of the Child, the Bank published the World Atlas of the Child, providing socioeconomic data on the conditions of children throughout the world."
1979,"The Bank does not trade in the currencies of its member countries for its own account. Under present policies, adjustments arising from translation of currencies to US dollar equivalents would not now, or in the future, result in realized gains or losses such as would result from the actual conversion into US dollars. A more detailed explanation of these policies is given in the ""Notes to Financial Statements"" (page 162)."

1986,"The most active borrowers from the IBRD were India ($1,743 million for six projects), Brazil ($1,620 million for eleven projects), and Indonesia ($1,132 million for eleven projects). IDA was most active in India ($625 million for six projects), Bangladesh ($463 million for six projects), and China ($450 million for four projects)."
1986,"The 4.3 percent growth in GDP was well below the average rate of growth that had occurred before 1980. More significantly, if data for China, India, and Brazil, which loom large in the statistical average for all developing countries, were excluded, GDP growth in 1984 slowed to 2.4 percent. With deteriorating terms of trade, per capita incomes fell in most of the developing world."
1986,"GDP growth. Growth performance varied substantially among regions (see Table 2-2). Asia's GDP rose by 6.1 percent, down from 8.7 percent in 1984. China reported continued growth at a rate above 10 percent in response to the continued success of internal reforms. In middle-income Asian countries, by contrast, growth slowed as the increase in manufactured exports moderated. The Republic of Korea, which achieved an average GDP growth rate of 9 percent between 1960 and 1970, grew by 5 percent, while Singapore's GDP actually fell by 1.8 percent, the first such decline registered by that country in twenty years. Indonesia and Malaysia also experienced slow growth, the result of stagnant oil and weak commodity prices. The continuing political and economic crisis in the Philippines produced another year of decline in GDP."
1986,"World cotton acreage increased by 11 percent in 1984/85 in response to favorable prices the year before; world prices for cotton then fell 21 percent in the 1984/85 season. Since then, however, the United States and China, both major cotton producers, have taken measures to reduce cotton production."
1986,"Balance of payments, debt, and financing. The current-account deficit of developing countries (excluding official transfers) amounted to $41 billion in 1985 (Table 2-4), up slightly over the year before, but more than $60 billion less than the peak deficit of $ 105 billion in 1981. This deficit amount is also considerably smaller than interest payments by developing countries on their long-term debt alone. Overall, developing countries' exports of goods and non-factor services (GNFs) almost equalled (and, excluding China, exceeded) their imports of GNFs. Collectively, for all developing countries other than China, and particularly for the highly indebted countries, national savings exceeded gross domestic investment and went, in part, to pay for the net cash flow owed to debtors."
1986,"crease was accounted for by only a few countries: China's import volumes, for example, rose by 27 percent, to the point where controls were imposed to contain the overheating economy in the second half of the year. By contrast, imports of middle-income countries increased by less than 0.5 percent. Adjustment in middle-income developing countries continued to reflect restrictive policies and constraints on imports rather than successful export promotion."
1986,"Private lenders remained extremely cautious in their lending to developing countries. Some countries enjoyed continued access to bank loans at low spreads, and a few East Asian countries—China, Korea, and Malaysia—were able to tap the bond markets. Most developing countries, however, were unable to obtain new net lending from private sources, except under rescheduling agreements. Negotiations for the rescheduling of existing debt were active in 1985 and covered nineteen World Bank members, including ten from sub-Saharan Africa and seven from Latin America. Altogether, twelve agreements were signed during 1985, representing $87 billion worth of negotiated debt relief, among them a $49 billion agreement, initially agreed to"
1986,"Food security—defined as access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life—is a central policy issue in many developing countries.3 This is not surprising, as food security is nonexistent for as many as one third of the population in the developing world, excluding the People's Republic of China. And, of these 730 million people, almost half—340 million—are acutely undernourished."
1986,"In mid 1985, the EDI created an Evaluation Committee that sets evaluation policies and procedures for the EDI's work and monitors their implementation. The Committee has reviewed the EDI's evaluation techniques and has broadened and strengthened their application. It is initiating an experimental evaluation of the effect of EDI training in one sector in three countries. It also is preparing a plan for the mid-term evaluation of the EDI's five-year plan that will be carried out in fiscal 1987 in collaboration with the Bank's Operations Evaluation Department. This work will include a special evaluation of EDI's program in China."
1986,"A last group of research projects is concerned with sectoral developments in agriculture, industry, and energy. One project deals with crop-livestock systems in sub-Saharan Africa. The objective of another is to understand how Chinese collectives and private enterprises are organized and how they function in China's economic system. A third will address the issues of efficient pricing of natural gas and of the optimal development of sources of natural gas."
1986,"China, after a year of exceptionally high growth in 1984, had to consolidate its gains and deal with some of the macroeconomic imbalances generated by rapid expansion, particularly a dramatic surge in imports and the related deterioration in its current-account balance."
1986,"In this environment of tightening international and domestic economic conditions, the World Bank continued to provide assistance for structural-adjustment efforts—aimed at strengthening the capacity and incentives for agricultural, industrial, and trade development— that were combined with measures designed to increase domestic-resource mobilization and improve the efficiency of resource allocation, especially in the public sector. In addition, support continued for longer-term development of human resources and of infrastructure. However, as in the preceding year, Bank lending to many of the countries in the region remained constrained by fiscal austerity measures made necessary by the difficult economic environment. China was an exception, as efforts by the Bank to assist the government in the design and implementation of its extensive economic reforms resulted in an expansion of Bank commitments. A major economic report by the Bank, which assessed the developmental needs and opportunities of the Chinese economy for the remainder of the century and explored options for further implementation of the government's broad agenda of policy reform, was published early in fiscal 1986.4"

1986,"However, considerable deterioration took place in the balance of payments. Stagnant exports and an increase in imports by more than half resulted in a current-account deficit of over $11 billion, a negative swing of $12 million as compared with 1984. The stagnation in exports may reflect a combination of weakening incentives for exporters, sluggish world demand for some products, and strong domestic demand. Tighter controls over imports were imposed in early 1985, but were not immediately effective. China's domestic currency also depreciated against the U.S. dollar, by about 14 percent in 1985."
1986,"China's economic reforms continued to make considerable progress. Rural reforms emphasize the growth and diversification of activities, both agricultural and nonagricultural, and the allocation of resources in agriculture now occurs largely through market mechanisms, with the government influencing supply and demand through procurement and pricing policies rather than physical quotas. Under the farm-procurement system introduced in 1985, procurement targets are set for grains, cotton, and a number of other products, and the government offers to contract for deliveries at a price expected to achieve the target. Individual farm households are free, in principle, to accept or reject the offer, which therefore, in effect, becomes a minimum price guarantee. Similarly, in urban reforms, an increasing proportion of industrial output is being allocated through market mechanisms, at flexible prices. Profit incentives have been strengthened and regularized for many state enterprises, and a large and growing collective sector in industry and services now fosters competition, as well as contributes to growth of output."
1986,"The most important short-term problems in China relate to demand management: Wages in state enterprises appear to be difficult to hold down; investment demand, also, is hard to restrain. For the longer term, reforms are needed in the areas of the social-security system, the allocation of labor and capital in the urban economy, and the remaining price distortions."
1986,"CHINA: IDA—$90 million.

1986,"Chinese economic growth continued to be impressive. Real GDP rose by 12.5 percent in 1985; personal incomes also increased sharply, reflecting higher urban wages and rural incomes; the gross value of industrial output rose by about 18 percent, led by a major surge in industrial activity; and gross agricultural output value (including rural industries) increased by about 13 percent, slightly below the increase in 1984, but well above previous medium-term trends. Planted acreage and output of grain and cotton were reduced in 1985, mainly the result of lower procurement prices and a smaller volume of guaranteed procurement, measures instituted by the government in response to overproduction in the previous year."
1986,"Under the CAM process, one person is now assigned overall responsibility for the design and implementation of the Bank's country-assistance strategy, the coordination of whatever resources are needed to execute the strategy, and the monitoring of progress and costs. This process links country objectives and costs more ex-plicity than ever before. It also helps clarify priorities and trade-offs and increases cost consciousness, thereby providing for more effective and efficient services to borrowers."
1986,"In several highly indebted countries, it is important that adequate export-credit cover be maintained to support adjustment programs aimed at restoring creditworthiness. The success of such adjustment will depend not only on the actions of the debtors themselves but also on the availability of external capital and an adequate flow of trade. The role of export credits in the adjustment process was reviewed in a conference convened by the Bank in May 1986. The meeting, attended by export-credit agencies from seventeen member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and, in most cases, their guardian authorities, elicited a consensus on the need for export-credit agencies, where appropriate, to support adjustment"
1986,"The worldwide economic recovery lost some of its momentum in calendar year 1985, and the growth rate of world output declined to 2.9 percent, down from 4.3 percent in 1984. The slowdown stemmed largely from a deceleration of growth in the United States, which had led the recovery in 1983 and 1984, and from the fact that this deceleration was not compensated for elsewhere in the industrial world, which continued to grow at unchanged, and, except for Japan, mostly low rates. The rate of increase in world trade dropped to just above 3 percent."
1986,"At the same time, the year also saw a number of important changes in the international economy that affected the performance and prospects of the developing countries. On the one hand, the decline in interest rates and low rates of inflation were positive developments to all. On the other hand, the fall in oil prices had both benign and adverse effects, depending on the composition of country imports and exports. The effect of these forces were, however, only partially realized by the developing countries, and, overall, the developing countries experienced a marked slowdown in export growth and declines in their terms of trade. Thus, their efforts to reestablish creditworthiness were set back, and the increase of their imports slowed down relative to 1984. Growth of output in developing countries also slowed with respect to 1984 and remained highly uneven among both regions and countries. Per capita incomes in sub-Saharan Africa deteriorated further, and the highly indebted countries faced increasing difficulties in adjusting their economies to the available finance."
1986,"plications for consumption, investment, and for trade."
1986,"Imbalances still remain large, however. The record current-account deficit of the United States was counterbalanced by a record Japanese surplus of $50 billion and a European surplus of $21 billion. Because of differences in accounting procedures, errors, and omissions, one cannot exactly ""balance"" global current accounts, but it seems quite certain that the collective payments surplus of the industrial countries has greatly diminished in recent years and that there is now a collective trade deficit. This largely corresponds to the trade surpluses in many developing countries, confronted with dried-up voluntary new capital inflows and rising debt-service obligations."
1986,The contradiction between the capital markets' demand that debtor countries generate trade surpluses and the frictions the surpluses have created with trade partners remains a potentially explosive issue. The large trade deficit of the United States has fueled calls for protectionist measures in that country and it has exac-
1986,"erbated trade tensions among industrial countries. However, one may hope that these will ease, thanks, in part, to the recent decline of the dollar."
1986,"The effect of a declining dollar, as expected, was delayed, as the dollar price of imports rose and that of exports dropped before the corresponding volumes had time to respond (the ""J-curve"" effect). However, the United States' trade deficit is now expected to decrease. Although, with present exchange rates and expected growth relationships, the deficit will not disappear, industrial-countries' prospects nevertheless appear more stable than they did last year. Part of the adjustment viewed as necessary a year ago has been completed, and financial authorities have achieved an impressive degree of coordination in managing it."
1986,"Developing countries had hoped that their recovery from the recession years of the early 1980s would continue to gain in momentum. Those hopes foundered, however, in the wake of the slowdown in the industrial countries: GDP growth in the developing countries slowed from 5.4 percent in 1984 to 4.3 percent in 1985, growth in export volume fell by more than 8 percentage points to 2.3 percent, and developing-country terms of trade were reduced by 1.1 percent, as commodity prices generally remained depressed. Only late in 1985—and early in 1986—was some relief felt by different groups of developing countries: first, by a number of the heavily indebted countries, which benefited from the decline in interest rates (and, in some cases, perhaps also from the fall in the value of the U.S. dollar), and second, by the oil-importing countries, which benefited from the break in the price of oil in the first quarter of 1986."
1986,"The 4.3 percent growth in GDP was well below the average rate of growth that had occurred before 1980. More significantly, if data for China, India, and Brazil, which loom large in the statistical average for all developing countries, were excluded, GDP growth in 1984 slowed to 2.4 percent. With deteriorating terms of trade, per capita incomes fell in most of the developing world."
1986,"Sub-Saharan Africa's GDP increased by only 1.2 percent, and its terms of trade also deteriorated. Thus, the erosion of per capita incomes in that region continued. Since 1980, this region's per capita GDP has fallen by 16.6 percent."
1986,"Gross domestic product increased by only 2.5 percent in Southern Europe and by 4.6 percent in the countries of North Africa and the Middle East (many of which, particularly the oil exporters, had to contend with a sharp deterioration in their terms of trade). Many countries faced the necessity of continuing long-standing austerity programs that had been adopted to reduce inflation and contain current-account deficits in the face of excessive debt. In Turkey, lib-"

The volume of developing countries' exports increased by only 2.3 percent in 1985, down from an increase of 10.7 percent in 1984 and less than half the 1965-80 average rate of growth (see Table 2-3), mostly the result of the slowdown in the aggregate growth of industrial countries, which also contributed to a deterioration in developing countries' terms of trade. Exports of manufactures from developing countries rose by only 3.3 percent, compared with 16.6 percent in 1984. The slowdown affected most major exporters of manufactures, including Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, Brazil, and Portugal. Countries that rely heavily on the United States' market, particularly in Latin America and East Asia, were most affected. This was partly the result of a sharp slowdown in growth in the United States and, for the majority whose currencies more or less follow the U.S. dollar (until the dollar started to decline in earnest late in the year), to a loss of competitiveness vis-a-vis Europe and Japan."
1986,"Most adversely affected by stagnant demand were primary-commodity exporting countries. The decline in the prices of primary commodities other than oil led to a 5.6 percent deterioration in 1985 in the terms of trade of the poorer African countries, the purchasing power of whose exports actually fell despite a 2 percent increase in volume. Continued weakness in the oil market, with increased production by higher-income countries, reduced the export revenues of oil-exporting developing nations by almost 5 percent."
1986,"Declines in lending, small increases in export revenues, and declines in terms of trade resulted in an increase in developing countries' merchandise imports of only 3.6 percent in volume, down from 5.8 percent in 1984. This modest in-"
1986,"countries have suffered continuous declines in per capita output and even steeper declines in per capita domestic expenditures as a result of the need to maintain trade surpluses to meet interest payments. In some countries, political institutions have been strained by the restrictive policies that parts of the public view as being needed only to generate repayments for foreign banks."
1986,"In the area of international trade policy, 1985 and early 1986 saw the initiation of a preparatory process within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) aimed at the early commencement of a new multilateral trade-negotiations round. Such a round is seen as a crucial mechanism to avoid a further increase in protectionist measures and as a means to reduce significantly barriers to trade in both developed and developing countries—a reduction that is important to the promotion of long-term growth and efficiency in all countries. A ministerial meeting of the GATT is currently scheduled for mid September 1986. It is expected that this meeting will mark the official start of these important trade negotiations."
1986,"in industrial countries and continued pursuit of reforms supported by increased financial flows in developing countries, in an open international trade environment. The actors, too, have been identified: governments in developing countries, which must pursue and accentuate their policy reforms; commercial creditors, for whose funds there is simply no substitute in sight, at least for the major indebted countries; and industrial-country governments, which not only must implement policies collectively conducive to more vigorous, noninflationary growth, but also take action, directly through the provision of concessional assistance and indirectly through support for international financial institutions, to help ensure that capital flows in adequate volume and on appropriate terms help bolster the debtors' adjustment efforts. Success is important, not just for the developing countries, but for the whole international economy. The task for 1986 and beyond is to get on with the effort."
1986,"Bank assistance for that strategy has included support for trade-policy reform and industrial restructuring to promote export production and encourage greater reliance on private-sector industries; agricultural reform, to overcome prevailing constraints to rational land use, to improve farming techniques, and to provide the modern inputs and support services necessary to bring about these changes; and education reform, to reorient the education and training system to respond better to the country's medium-term development needs and improve the efficiency of resources use in the sector that consumes the largest share of public resources. In addition, a public-enterprise rehabilitation loan is currently being prepared to improve the efficiency of public enterprises in a number of sectors."
1986,"The study called on the international community to take into account its four major conclusions when strategies to achieve food security are being devised: that (a) the lack of food security is the lack of purchasing power of people and nations; (b) food security neither necessarily nor only comes from achieving food self-sufficiency in a country, or from a rapid increase in food production; (c) long-term food security can be achieved through economic growth and the alleviation of poverty, but, in the short term, it results from a redistribution of purchasing power and resources; and (d) that transitory food insecurity can be reduced through measures that facilitate trade and provide income relief to target groups."
1986,"Each study will attempt to develop a common analytical framework for the study of a particular policy question in a large number of countries. The comparative-studies program coincides with the Bank's comparative advantage in research and will reinforce, and be reinforced by, the Bank's policy dialogue with its member countries. Launched in February 1984 with the study on ""The Timing and Sequencing of a Trade Liberalization Policy,"" the program now includes studies on ""Agricultural Pricing Policies"" and ""Poverty, Equity, and Growth."" A fourth comparative study, ""Macroeconomic Adjustment and Long-run Growth,"" is being prepared to deal with the central issues of the effects of macroeconomic management during periods of crises on long-term growth."
1986,"A second group of research starts is concerned with the issues of adjustment and related policies in response to external shocks. The objective is to develop an analytical framework useful to the Bank in designing structural-adjustment programs. One study will focus on second-best adjustment policies, including exchange-rate and fiscal policies, when nominal wages cannot adjust as a response to shocks. A second study focuses on the questions of how labor markets have adjusted to shocks and how the effectiveness of policy measures such as trade liberalization, devaluation, and fiscal-deficit reduction is influenced by the structure and performance of the labor markets. A third is concerned with the financial and macroeconomic aspects of the debt problem, the analysis of which could be useful for devising foreign-borrowing strategies. A fourth study will attempt to draw the lessons of"
1986,"In the area of international economic environment, two topics highly relevant to developing countries will be studied: the magnitude of non-tariff barriers to international trade and their effects on the level and composition of imports in the industrial countries and the question of how developing countries can use international trade in services to enhance their development."
1986,"Through high-level consultations, interagency seminars, and exchanges of visits, the Bank continued to strengthen its traditional relationships within the UN system. As in previous years, Bank staff participated in a number of UN meetings. These included the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development's (UNCTAD) ""Mid-Term Review of the Substantial New Program of Action for the Least Developed Countries,"" the World Conference to Review the Achievements of the UN Decade for Women, the General Assembly Special Session on the Critical Economic Situation in Africa, and the Conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO). Bank staff also attended ministerial and other meetings of the UN Regional Commission for Africa (ECA), the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC)."
1986,"Relations with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and its Development Assistance Committee (DAC) remain strong. Senior Bank staff participated regularly in OECD and DAC meetings at both the ministerial and working-party levels. Issues considered included the effectiveness of aid-coordination mechanisms, development cooperation with middle-income countries, and aid to agriculture in low-income countries. The Bank welcomed the comprehensive review of development-cooperation experience undertaken by the DAC on the occasion of its twenty-fifth anniversary. During fiscal 1986, Bank staff prepared working papers for a number of DAC seminars, including one on the role of nongovernmental organizations in agricultural and rural development in sub-Saharan Africa and another on technical assistance for public-sector management. Regular consultations were also held between staff of the Bank and the OECD on such ongoing issues as concessional flows, trade, debt reporting and analyses, and global economic prospects."

1986,"2 The period 1978-80, before the impact of the second oil shock had set in, was a good one for the region. Its terms of trade declined precipitously in 1981, however, falling 21 percent in one year. By 1985, they were 4.6 percent below the average for 1982-84."
1986,"By 1980, seven governments in the region had resorted to borrowing from domestic banks in excess of 5 percent of GDP; current-account deficits had exceeded 10 percent of GDP in seven countries; and nine countries had experienced double-digit inflation. Several governments responded to these financial disequilibria by attempts at stabilization. For example, in the period 1983-85, fifteen International Monetary Fund (IMF) Stand-by Arrangements were reached with nine countries, involving cutbacks in public-sector deficits; ceilings on credit expansion; reforms of the exchange and trade system; liberalization of, and increases in, producer prices; and greater flexibility in exchange rates."
1986,"Partly in concert with exchange-rate depreciation, the internal terms of trade for the agricultural sector were improved in many countries. Nine countries offered higher relative prices to agricultural producers during 1985, in many cases continuing policies initiated earlier. These improvements sometimes took place in the context of broader reforms in procurement and marketing systems that had tended to be dominated by inefficient parastatals. During the period 1983-85, for instance, Madagascar lifted a government monopoly on the marketing of paddy and rice, while abolishing fixed paddy and rice prices, as well as a consumer-price subsidy; Tanzania licensed private traders to enter the maize market, removed price controls on maize meal, and partially liberalized interregional trade in maize. Somalia reduced the public sector's role in grain purchases and in the distribution of several agricultural inputs, and Zambia abolished an official monopoly on the marketing of maize and on the supply of all agricultural inputs except fertilizers."
1986,"The debt problems of the most seriously affected countries stem from several causes. Except for Zambia, loans were not raised on particularly hard terms (though a large part of IMF resources was drawn upon on relatively hard terms in the 1980s). Several countries (Zaire and Zambia, and, to a smaller extent, Somalia and Tanzania) delayed reducing their consumption expenditures by borrowing abroad when confronted with a deterioration in their terms of trade or other adverse events. Some countries, such as Somalia and Sudan, tried to sustain unwarranted levels of consumption in periods when external circumstances were not in their favor. Madagascar and Sudan tried to carry out overly ambitious investment plans. In general, there was a tendency on the part of governments to use borrowed resources unproductively be-"
1986,"The debt overhang is a legacy of past mistakes. Unless handled skillfully by all parties to the debt difficulties, however, it can undermine efforts to stabilize and restructure debtor economies and restore growth to them. Recent efforts by debtors, such as Madagascar, Zaire, and Zambia, to carry out intensive reforms have encountered considerable difficulty: Foreign suppliers have charged price premia because the overhang makes payments uncertain; trade credit has dried up, reducing debtor capacity to buy in the most competitive markets; commercial banks and export-credit agencies have reduced their exposure, without offsetting resources being made available on concesssional terms; and key officials of debtor governments have had to spend considerable time negotiating with creditors. Consequently, debtor economies that try to emerge from their difficulties have encountered chronic shortages of critically needed imports, weakening the incentive and abilities of governments to persist with economic reforms."
1986,"The countries of Eastern and Southern Africa face a year of opportunity in calendar year 1986. The sharp decline in the price of oil will save nearly $600 million in foreign exchange for the countries of the region. Coffee exporters (Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zaire) will benefit from a large increase in price; this windfall gain is expected to yield almost $1 billion over normal earnings from coffee. Copper and sugar prices, though still at low levels, are expected to rise slightly during 1986. Hence, the combined terms-of-trade index for the region is likely to improve by almost 20 percent."
1986,Nigeria's medium-term and long-term external public debt outstanding at the end of 1985 amounted to $11.5 billion (excluding converted trade arrears of $1.7 billion). Substantial additional trade arrears have been estimated to range between $3.5 billion and $6 billion. The severity of Nigeria's current debt relates not so much to
1986,"At the December 1985 meeting of the consultative group for Ghana, the government presented donors with the framework for a program of further progress on exchange-rate adjustment and trade liberalization, public-sector reforms, and increased domestic-resource mobilization to finance a higher level of investment."
1986,"In this environment of tightening international and domestic economic conditions, the World Bank continued to provide assistance for structural-adjustment efforts—aimed at strengthening the capacity and incentives for agricultural, industrial, and trade development— that were combined with measures designed to increase domestic-resource mobilization and improve the efficiency of resource allocation, especially in the public sector. In addition, support continued for longer-term development of human resources and of infrastructure. However, as in the preceding year, Bank lending to many of the countries in the region remained constrained by fiscal austerity measures made necessary by the difficult economic environment. China was an exception, as efforts by the Bank to assist the government in the design and implementation of its extensive economic reforms resulted in an expansion of Bank commitments. A major economic report by the Bank, which assessed the developmental needs and opportunities of the Chinese economy for the remainder of the century and explored options for further implementation of the government's broad agenda of policy reform, was published early in fiscal 1986.4"
1986,"The Philippines continued to focus on the implementation of a stabilization program designed to adjust the balance of payments and reduce inflation. Some success was achieved: The current-account deficit was reduced from 8 percent of gross national product (GNP) in 1983 to 1 percent in 1985, and the domestic inflation rate was reduced from 50 percent in 1984 to 6 percent. Major policy measures taken related to the control of monetary expansion and a reduction in government expenditures. At the same time, the exchange rate was allowed to float, restrictions of foreign-exchange allocations and limits on foreign-exchange holdings by private banks were eliminated, price controls on a number of basic commodities, including rice, were lifted, and the restrictions on some of the regulated imports were lifted as part of a program of trade liberalization."
1986,"Thailand's rate of economic growth slowed from 6 percent in 1984 to about 4 percent in 1985, as its terms of trade worsened — the result of low international commodity prices and reduced incomes, especially in agriculture. The country's current-account deficit improved slightly, from 5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1984 to 3.8 percent in 1985. At the same time, the public-sector deficit widened to about 6.5 percent of GDP, despite a reduction in public investments and a slowing down in the growth rate of consumption. The widening gap between savings and investment was filled largely with external borrowings by the private sector."
1986,"Thailand's terms of trade are expected to improve in fiscal 1987 if oil prices remain low while other commodity prices remain at least stable. An improvement in the country's trade account is likely to be offset somewhat, however, by the expected reduction in remittances from Thai workers employed in the Middle East. Because persistence of fiscal constraints will require continued restraint in public investment over the coming years, private investments, financed by domestic savings, will have to be the primary source of revived growth. In view of the modest outlook for domestic demand in the coming years, the government has given high priority to promoting exports, especially of manufactures."
1986,"A significant increase in inflation occurred during the year, however, and the current-account deficit rose by $10 million to $95 million. The rate of inflation jumped to more than 50 percent, the result of monetary expansion and adjustments to official prices and wages in the state sector. As in previous years, the trade deficit remained large, with export earnings amounting to only 29 percent of imports."
1986,Islands Dependent on World Trade
1986,"Along with the current problems of short-term stabilization, South Asian countries are also preoccupied with the need to promote rapidly the process of structural adjustment to achieve a more viable balance of payments. Attention is being directed, therefore, toward bringing about a sustained expansion of exports, and, in particular, exports of manufactures. The objective is being sought through trade-liberalization policies, policies to increase economic efficiency and competitiveness, and provision of incentives to the private sector. Governments also expect that these measures will provide increased employment opportunities in the industrial sector and help enhance their creditworthiness for external commercial borrowing (an important consideration at a time when concessional assistance from industrial countries has declined)."
1986,"In pursuance of the objectives of the seventh plan, a number of policy initiatives and reforms have been set in motion to modernize industry, upgrade technology, and replace monopoly markets with competitive ones in order to generate higher rates of growth and employment. A significant development has been the announcement of a long-term fiscal policy that aims at providing a stable economic environment under which uncertainties can be reduced and the foundations of economic growth can be set firmly into place. A relatively liberal import regime has been continued (despite a large trade"
1986,"The past two years appear to have been marked by a gradual slowing in the impressive performance of the Sri Lankan economy. Between 1977 and 1984, real GDP grew at an annual rate of close to 6 percent. This rapid growth, stimulated by major policy changes that were part of the broad program launched in 1977-78 to decontrol the economy, liberalize trade, and place greater reliance on market forces, was accompanied by an expansion in paddy output that brought the country close to food-grain self-sufficiency. An ambitious public-investment program, highlighted by the major works associated with the Mahaweli irrigation and power-development scheme, helped to create the basis for sustaining the country's"
1986,"policy measures, designed to stabilize the economy in the short term, have been adopted recently: These include a broad range of fiscal, monetary, and balance-of-payments policies, along with reforms aimed at rationalizing and liberalizing the trade and exchange system. Attention is also being devoted to defining issues and appropriate policies in agriculture, industry, transport, and population planning, as well as in the export sector."
1986,"The restraint on investment expenditures also contributed to a substantial deceleration in the growth of imports; imports by major borrowers increased by less than 1 percent in 1985, compared with nearly 5 percent the previous year. Exports of goods and nonfactor services, by contrast, grew rapidly in volume terms—by almost 7 percent, despite the slowdown in world trade. This performance, which came on the heels of export growth of 11 percent in volume terms in 1984, indicates that adjustment programs are taking hold and are having an effect. Since 1980, for instance, as a result of efforts of the major borrowers to reduce their external-finance requirements, exports have increased by about 60 percent in volume, while imports have increased by much less, by about 10 percent in volume. As a result of this underlying real performance, balance-of-payments deficits, on the average, have been cut in half; in 1984-85, current-account deficits averaged 1.9 percent of GDP for the region's major borrowers, compared with 3.9 percent in 1979-82. In this regard, calendar year 1985 witnessed a modest decline in balance-of-payments deficits from 1984 levels."
1986,"This growth performance reflects the international economic environment and the adjustment policies pursued by countries primarily to meet debt-service obligations. Sustained adjustment performance and dramatic results were achieved in the past year: The larger countries continued to generate the trade surpluses necessary to service debt, and, for the region as a whole, a trade surplus of $34 billion was attained (as compared with $39 billion in 1984 and a trade deficit of $1.7 billion in 1981). In contrast with 1984, however, the 1985 trade surplus was neither achieved nor facilitated through export growth. The region's exports in 1985 fell by 5.7 percent (in nominal U.S. dollars), as compared with growth of nearly 12 percent in 1984."
1986,"The region's disappointing export performance in 1985, shared by most countries, made the containment of imports essential in order to generate the trade surpluses necessary to meet debt-service obligations. Total imports for the region were further reduced to $58 billion in 1985, contributing to a 41 percent decline since 1981. In general, reductions in imports have been realized through policies that reduce aggregate domestic demand, by both exchange-rate adjustments and the continued use of quantitative import restrictions."
1986,"In the aggregate, the region's trade surplus for 1985 was roughly equivalent to the amount of its net interest payments ($35 billion). Interest payments abroad were equal to about 38 percent of the region's exports of goods; such percentages were especially high for Argentina (66 percent), Chile (45 percent), and Bolivia (34 percent). These payments continue to constitute a heavy burden both in terms of effecting resource transfers abroad (through the generation of trade surpluses) and of marshalling the domestic resources for those transfers. The region's external-interest payments now equal about 6 percent of its combined GDP. For some countries, such as Chile and Argentina, this percentage approaches—or exceeds—the 10 percent"
1986,"justment; investment priorities are being redefined and appropriate balance-of-payments policies, including reductions in imports, are being adopted. Recent years have brought a series of external shocks, each requiring further adjustment. Nonetheless, supply responses to significant market incentives, as well as a variety of initiatives to develop extraregional export markets, have been limited, highlighting some of the difficulties of promoting structural adjustment in small economies. Intraregional trade fell in 1985, offsetting increased exports to extraregional markets. While several countries recognize that a reduction in public-sector deficits is essential, achievement has been difficult so long as growth in revenues remains sluggish and an unwillingness to curb expenditures, particularly in public-sector wage bills, continues. In several countries, however, tangible efforts have been made to encourage private investment and to reduce the role of the public sector."
1986,"First, there is increasing recognition that policies affecting external trade must be revised. For a generation or more, the dominant thinking in Latin America on foreign trade has been the need to promote import substitution. Protection of industrial activities through tariffs and quantitative restrictions has been high, while policies frequently penalized agriculture. Exchange rates, more often than not, were overvalued. The results of such policies have been low ratios"
1986,"of external trade to GDP and a heavy dependence on commodity exports. Today, by contrast, most countries have competitive exchange rates, while policies that can boost exports, particularly of manufactured products, are under review."
1986,"Several examples of policy loans approved during fiscal 1986 illustrate the range of policy reforms supported through Bank operations: A $250 million loan to Colombia provides support for extensive reforms in that country's commercial and agricultural policies that aim at diversifying and expanding exports and increasing agricultural production; a structural-adjustment loan to Chile of $250 million, in addition to supporting trade-policy liberalization, also supports government measures to rationalize public investment, protect the economy from severe copper-price fluctuations, and increase domestic savings; for Ecuador, a loan of $ 100 million supported a series of policy measures for the agricultural sector, including a liberalization of agricultural-pricing policies, a reduction in trade restrictions, and a curtailment of the government's participation in selected public enterprises. Other recent policy-based operations include loans to Brazil for public-sector management reforms and for improvements in agricultural policies, and to Argentina for agricultural-taxation reforms."

1992,"Aggregate statistics for 1991 were influenced by the sharp decline in output in Central and Eastern Europe, as well as by the adverse effects of the Gulf crisis on several economies in the Middle East. Excluding Central and Eastern Europe, growth in developing countries in 1991 was 3.4 percent, compared with 3.8 percent during the 1980s. Estimates of GDP growth by major geographic region show an acceleration in Latin America and in sub-Saharan Africa; an increase in China's growth rate helped to sustain high rates of growth in the East Asia region."
1992,"Aggregate statistics for 1991 were dominated by the sharp decline in output in Central and Eastern Europe and by the severely adverse effects of the Gulf crisis on the economies of Middle Eastern countries. Estimates of GDP by major geographic region reveal that growth of output accelerated in Latin America and in sub-Saharan Africa, while a pick-up in China helped sustain Asian activity. Despite a sharp slowdown in India, where GDP growth fell from 5.5 percent in 1990 to 2.5 percent, the population-weighted growth rate of developing countries' GDP—3.5 percent in 1991—continued to exceed the ordinary measure.2"
1992,"Growth in output in East Asia, supported by the continued vibrant performance of the region's exports, as well as by a firming of domestic demand, particularly in China, accelerated to about 6.8 percent in 1991. The sharp acceleration of GDP growth in China, from 4.5 percent to over 6 percent, was supported by improvements in industrial output, higher levels of consumer spending, and significant gains in the export of manufactures. Despite the slowdown in industrial-country markets, export volumes for the group of East Asian countries advanced at double-digit rates, implying gains in market share. A moderate slackening in GDP growth from the rapid 9 percent-to-10 percent gains of 1990 occurred in the dynamic economies of the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand, in part reflecting a catch-up of imports. The major risk facing this highly trade-oriented region is the potential for sluggishness or disruption in world-trade flows. Economic weakness in some of the region's traditional export markets has underlined the importance of market diversification, including a further strengthening of ties within the region. Increasingly buoyant intra-regional trade in East Asia may be viewed as evidence of an ongoing process of ""market-oriented"" regional integration, a development that could partially offset lackluster progress in the area of multilateral trade agreements."
1992,"Large production increases in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in China, put downward pressure on cotton prices during the second half of 1991. Increased exports from the Soviet Union, partly from the previous year's crop, added to the pressure. Further downward pressure was exerted on cotton prices by payments made by the U.S. government to domestic mills and exporters to maintain the competitiveness of U.S. cotton during the period of plentiful supply. Natural rubber prices declined mildly, mainly because of further cutbacks in automobile production."
1992,"Fiscal 1992 saw Bank lending targeted at the prevention or eradication of specific diseases in four countries: schistosomiasis and tuberculosis in China, schistosomiasis in Egypt, AIDS in India, and malaria in Sao Tome and Principe. The $84 million AIDS project in India was the Bank's second freestanding project designed to prevent the spread of that disease (see Box 3-2)."

Gender issues are increasingly being addressed in infrastructure projects (one out of every three as compared with one in five in fiscal 1991), in particular, those that focus on rural water supply (China and Lesotho) and feeder roads (Ghana)."
1992,"Private-sector development was an essential part of the fiscal 1992 work programs in the East Asia and Pacific and South Asia regions, as well. India's significant progress toward liberalization and deregulation was facilitated by Bank studies on trade and financial reform, for example, and was supported by the Bank's first structural-adjustment loan to that country. To identify paths for reform and eventual privatization of some activities in China, the Bank has assisted with sector analyses of housing, land, and industry. The Bank also fostered direct privatization in the development of sectors previously reserved for the government through projects in Indonesia's telecommunications sector and Pakistan's hydrocarbon subsector. It also supported the preparation of broader privatization programs in Bangladesh, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and Nepal."

1992,"Table 5-1 shows the regional distribution of EDI's training by sector and number of participants. In accordance with its strategic objectives, about one third of EDI's training programs during the year were targeted toward sub-Saharan Africa. This number understates the share of EDI resources devoted to the region, as a large concentration of EDI's institution-strengthening efforts were also targeted to sub-Saharan Africa. In Asia, EDI's China program declined as a consequence of reduced United Nations Development Programme funding. For Asia as a whole, however, there were compensatory increases in activities, notably in Viet Nam and in the Pacific island countries. The number of activities carried out in and for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe rose sharply in response to the demand accompanying their transition from command to market economies. In addition, EDI implemented eight activities in the former Soviet Union that were financed by the Bank's Technical Cooperation Agreement. Endeavors to build a larger, more sustained training program for the countries in the Middle East and in Latin America, however, continued to suffer from the relative lack of support on the part of most cofinancing partners."

1992,"At the beginning of 1991, there were reasons to temper the optimism usually associated with the region. Growth of world trade, which is so crucial for the outward-oriented economies of East Asia, was slowing. Growing protectionism in some industrialized countries and slow progress in the GATT negotiations were matters of serious concern. China's austerity program was in full swing, and efforts continued to address the overheating of the economy witnessed in previous years. After three years of double-digit growth, the economies of Malaysia and Thailand were beginning to display signs of overheating and of supply-side bottlenecks, particularly in the area of transportation and in the availability of skilled labor. Both countries were affected by the uncertainties about energy prices that accompanied the Gulf crisis. Despite Indonesia's successful adjustment in the 1980s, concerns over macroeconomic stability, based largely on the rapid private-sector response to structural reforms that led to a surge in imports and investment, were beginning to reemerge. The Philippines had been severely affected by a string of natural disasters and by the Gulf crisis through a drop in workers' remittances from the Gulf area and an increase in oil prices; in the Republic of Korea, rapidly rising labor costs were eroding its export competitiveness; and in Papua New Guinea, recessionary pressures, which had begun in the wake of a sharp decline in output in 1989, had not yet eased."
1992,"impressive than in 1990. Malaysia and Korea led the way, with GDP growth rates of 8.8 percent and 8.7 percent, respectively. China, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and Thailand were close behind, with rates of growth ranging from 6.4 percent to 8.2 percent. Inflation was in single digits for all these countries. Even in a year that saw little growth in world trade, these six countries experienced double-digit growth in export volume."
1992,"Progress in reducing poverty is difficult to monitor on a year-to-year basis. However, the most recent analysis suggests that, for the region as a whole, the proportion of the population below the poverty line is about ll percent. Rapid growth and emphasis on social development in Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand have combined to reduce the absolute number of people living in poverty. In these countries, however, problems of income disparity have not improved significantly. Poverty remains widespread in the Philippines and is becoming problematic in the three Indochi-nese states and Mongolia, which are in the process of opening up their economies to market forces. Progress in reducing poverty has also slowed in China."
1992,"The region includes four socialist economies—China, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Mongolia, and Viet Nam—that are in the process of becoming more market-oriented. Each has followed a different path of change. Over the past twelve years, China has followed a gradual approach toward reform, while Viet Nam, faced with severe external shocks, has had to make sharp adjustments."
1992,"the exception of Mongolia, these policies stimulated a good supply response in 1991. Different policies have been adopted on price reform, however: China is following a two-track approach, keeping part (declining over time) of production at government-determined prices and allowing market forces to determine prices for the rest of production. Mongolia has declared its intention to liberalize the prices of most commodities and to deregulate its trade and distribution systems. Lao PDR and Viet Nam have implemented programs of radical price liberalization that have freed virtually all"
1992,"China has thus far followed a two-pronged approach of encouraging nonstate enterprises to emerge in fields not monopolized by the SOEs and of reforming the SOEs. Indeed, the source of vigorous growth in the coastal provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu has been the dynamic nonstate sector that is made up of collectives, joint ventures, foreign ventures, and individual enterprises. (The GDP of Guangdong, which borders Hong Kong, grew by an estimated 13 percent in 1991, while the national economy grew at a little more than half that rate.) Mongolia has announced its intention to privatize almost all small state enterprises and has completed preparations for the privatization of large ones. Lao PDR is also following a policy of fairly rapid privatization—the number of state enterprises is to be reduced from 640 to around 30 over a ten-year period. Viet Nam is now ready to speed up enterprise reform after having reduced direct subsidies to enterprises and restrained their access to bank credit."
1992,"These reforms are influenced as much by initial country conditions and associated external shocks as by the nature of the reforms themselves. China's reforms have been the longest lasting and the most successful in stimulating growth and productivity without sacrificing stability or equity. During 1987-88, when growth soared to double-digit levels, the Chinese economy began to experience inflationary pressures. However, by late 1989, macroeconomic stability was largely restored, and this stability was sustained through 1991."
1992,"Reforming SOEs is the central challenge for China and Viet Nam. Despite continuing budgetary subsidies and bank credit, SOE output and employment growth in China remain relatively sluggish, unsold production is accumulating in warehouses, indebtedness is mounting, and at least three of every ten SOEs are losing money (the government estimates that its SOEs ran up losses totaling $5.7 billion in 1991). The Chinese authorities now recognize that, ultimately, state firms can only be fully exposed to hard budget constraints, with attendant bankruptcies and unemployment, to the extent that their 100 million-strong work force is freed from its dependence on the ""work unit"" for housing, pensions, and income security. This realization has led the government to pursue programs of housing reform and schemes for communitywide pension pooling and unemployment insurance. Plans have also been announced to create selected ""enterprise groups"" through the merger of SOEs that cut across geographical and administrative boundaries and permit labor redeployment to be internalized. Such measures will take time to bear fruit, and, in the short term, the authorities are resigned to the necessity of providing further financial injections to the SOE sector."
1992,"China, because of its size, as well as the depth of its environmental problems, presents the region's most serious environmental challenge. Levels of air and water pollution in some of its major cities are among the highest in the world. Depending inevitably on coal as a major energy source, China faces a tremendous challenge in finding effective ways to improve the environment through reducing emissions of ""greenhouse"" gases. The Chinese authorities are actively engaged in tackling these issues. Over the past decade, China has set up comprehensive environmental laws and regulations, as well as an impressive institutional network for policy enforcement and monitoring. In 1991, the government marked the tenth anniversary of the passage of its National Environment Protection Law by strengthening further the law's provisions for on-site enforcement and by introducing new measures to prohibit the use of heavily polluting industrial technology. China also ratified the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer, opening the way for assistance from the Bank and other international agencies in developing strategies and investment programs for the phase-out of chlo-rofluorocarbons and other chlorine-based and bromine-based chemicals."
1992,"Lending operations in China and Indonesia accounted for about 75 percent of the total. Commitments to the Philippines totaled $430.3 million. Lending operations have stabilized in recent years in mature borrowers such as Thailand and Malaysia; lending levels in those countries during the year were in the $200 million-to-$300 million range. In Korea, the government and the Bank have agreed to phase out Bank lending by fiscal 1995. During the phase-out period, lending will average between $300 million and $400 million annually, and loan amounts will progressively diminish. During this period, lending will concentrate on the social sectors, social infrastructure, small and medium industry, the environment, and other areas that have been neglected."
1992,"During the past decade, South Asian countries encountered their share of the difficulties that faced most of the developing world. Nonetheless, real growth of gross domestic product (GDP) in the region averaged 4.8 percent a year over this period, compared with only 4.3 percent a year among low-income countries in general (excluding China).

Six investment projects had been approved: conserving the environment in Bhutan, preserving biodiversity in Poland, displacing fossil fuels with bagasse for energy production in Mauritius, conserving biodiversity in Mexico, handling and disposing of, in an environmentally sound manner, ships' waste in six Chinese ports, and afforestation in Ecuador. The projects in Bhutan and Poland were freestanding projects, financed entirely by the GEF; the other four were Bank Group projects in which the GEF funded a component."
1992,"Pragmatism and flexibility have been the hallmarks of policymaking in most East Asian economies. Thus, both Thailand and Malaysia responded quickly to oil-price rises: Thailand, an oil importer, by raising fuel prices, and Malaysia, an oil exporter, by increasing its oil production to meet regional demand. Malaysia also accelerated plans for recovering gas deposits located off the west coast of the peninsula. To guard against economic overheating, monetary authorities in both countries tightened credit and the money supply and improved tax-collection machinery. The agility of the Indonesian authorities was particularly impressive: When deregulation looked like it might lead to an excessive expansion of domestic and foreign borrowings, the authorities moved swiftly to curtail domestic monetary expansion and scale down public-investment programs and external borrowings. The Chinese authorities also succeeded in correcting overheating without causing a recession and resumed their policy reforms after the consolidation process."

1992,"During fiscal 1992, the Bank assisted the countries with some of the critical tasks in the transition and began to identify some of the major elements of Bank assistance strategies. These will be developed for each country and complemented with an assessment of financing needs. The general elements include (a) key aspects of systemic reform, especially trade and price liberalization, private-sector development, and privatization; (b) sector-specific reforms, covering in particular the financial, food, energy, transport, and housing sectors; (c) improvements in policies and programs related to social safety nets; and (d) human-resource development, including training and institutional development."
1992,"The Bank is also striving to ensure that the unfinished agenda of the 1980s is carried through, where appropriate, while the priorities for the 1990s are being addressed. In some instances, the complementarities are obvious: Female education, for example, promotes the interests of women in development and enhances human development more broadly. In other instances, the links and tradeoffs are more complex and cannot be resolved except in concrete country programs."
1992,"The number and complexity of objectives and policies that are crucial to development pose new challenges in the design and implementation of programs. They are also far more demanding on Bank resources and staff. Designing a country strategy for agriculture, for example, is now much more complex and must go beyond ""traditional"" technical and economic concerns to focus on strengthening the roles of the private sector and women, protecting the environment, enhancing agriculture's role in combating poverty within and beyond the sector, and addressing links to trade and other economywide policies."

These trends were compounded by worsening economic conditions in the Soviet Union and"
1992,"Against this deteriorating global background, the improvement in economic performance in a few developing regions in 1991—which carried over into 1992—was especially noteworthy. This improvement is attributable, in part, to the implementation by many governments of measures to stabilize their economies and restructure incentives to encourage private initiative and international trade. Policy reforms in Latin America helped to moderate inflation and domestic demand; East Asian economies, supported by growth in export volume in the range of 10 percent and by robust domestic demand, continued to grow rapidly. Sub-Saharan Africa raised its real GDP growth rate from 1.3 percent in 1990 to 2.4 percent in 1991."
1992,"In the commodity market, prices of all major categories declined in 1991. The index of nonoil primary commodity prices in nominal dollar terms declined for the third consecutive year, and the index in real terms hit an all-time low. Growth in the volume of world trade in constant dollar terms declined from 5 percent in 1990 to 3 percent in 1991, mainly the result of the slowdown in industrial countries' import demand. There were no breakthroughs in the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations on key elements, and the outcome remains in doubt."
1992,"A notable development in 1991 was a narrowing of current-account imbalances of most major industrial countries (see Table 2-2). The U.S. current-account deficit moved to near balance (only 0.2 percent of gross domestic product). The trade component of the deficit narrowed as lower inflation and earlier dollar depreciation improved competitiveness, while the transfers component moved into substantial surplus because of war-related payments. Moreover, there was a remarkable swing in the"
1992,"• Structural transformation and the collapse of trade with the Soviet Union and its successor states combined to induce a deep recession in most of Central and Eastern Europe, while the sharp compression of imports by the Soviet Union adversely affected its other trading partners (such as India)."
1992,"Despite the slowdown in the industrial countries—particularly in the United States—improvements in economic performance in Latin America were widespread. The region's GDP rose by 3.0 percent in 1991, thus reversing the slide in annual per capita income that had taken place over the past decade. Growth rates were in excess of 4 percent in Argentina, Chile, and Mexico,, and reached a high of 9.1 percent in Venezuela. Policy reforms covering fiscal adjustment, trade and investment liberalization, the financial sector, and public-enterprise restructuring and privatization, supported by debt restructuring, have helped to moderate inflation in the region and strengthen domestic demand. Chile has now been growing at an average annual rate of 4.5 percentage points"
1992,"Growth in output in East Asia, supported by the continued vibrant performance of the region's exports, as well as by a firming of domestic demand, particularly in China, accelerated to about 6.8 percent in 1991. The sharp acceleration of GDP growth in China, from 4.5 percent to over 6 percent, was supported by improvements in industrial output, higher levels of consumer spending, and significant gains in the export of manufactures. Despite the slowdown in industrial-country markets, export volumes for the group of East Asian countries advanced at double-digit rates, implying gains in market share. A moderate slackening in GDP growth from the rapid 9 percent-to-10 percent gains of 1990 occurred in the dynamic economies of the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand, in part reflecting a catch-up of imports. The major risk facing this highly trade-oriented region is the potential for sluggishness or disruption in world-trade flows. Economic weakness in some of the region's traditional export markets has underlined the importance of market diversification, including a further strengthening of ties within the region. Increasingly buoyant intra-regional trade in East Asia may be viewed as evidence of an ongoing process of ""market-oriented"" regional integration, a development that could partially offset lackluster progress in the area of multilateral trade agreements."
1992,"In Europe and Central Asia, GDP contracted by about 7 percent, as stabilization and reform programs in several countries had not yet led to a bottoming-out in their economies. Average output of the Central and East European economies, including Yugoslavia, is estimated to have dropped by 14 percent, following a decline of 8.7 percent in 1990. Estimates of economic decline among the five reforming economies in this region range from 7.5 percent in Hungary to 26 percent in Bulgaria. However, efforts to liberalize imports and diversify exports—which followed the disbanding of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) trading block—led to strong growth in trade between Eastern Europe and the industrialized countries."
1992,"Growth accelerated in sub-Saharan Africa to 2.4 percent in 1991, in part the result of the indirect stimulation of Nigeria's economy by the Gulf crisis, not only through temporarily higher oil prices but also through its success in exploiting new oilfields quickly. For the past five years, the prices of nonoil commodities exported by most West African countries (ro-busta coffee and cocoa, for example) have fared worse than those that are particularly important for East and Southern African countries (mild arabica coffee and copper, for example). Such sustained losses in terms of trade have contributed to growth performance in West Africa that is poorer than in East and Southern Africa."
1992,Trends in World Trade
1992,"The growth in the volume of world trade slackened to 3 percent during 1991 (see Table 2-7), in marked contrast to the robust 7 per-cent-to-9 percent growth experienced during the late 1980s. In nominal-dollar terms, exports in 1991 increased by a mere 1.5 percent—down from 13.5 percent growth in 1990. The flattening out of export prices in dollars reflected the switch from dollar depreciation in 1990 tc appreciation in 1991, the rise and fall of oil prices, and the continued decline of nonoil commodity prices. Trade in commercial services was also affected by the economic slowdown, increasing by only 5 percent, as compared with 17 percent in 1990."
1992,"The lackluster growth in world trade was attributable, in large measure, to the slowdown in import demand in the industrial countries; it was compounded, however, by the virtual collapse of trade among the former members of the CMEA. Among the industrial countries, softening trends in investment spending, particularly in North America and Japan, served to dampen exports of capital goods. Some of these negative factors appeared to be on the wane by early 1992, and growth of world trade may have begun to rise again in the second half of 1991, according to preliminary figures."
1992,Several developments in 1991 helped to sustain the momentum in world trade:
1992,"• Trade among European countries was supported by the process of unification in Germany, which not only resulted in a strong 11 percent advance in the volume of German imports but also sustained production and exports in neighboring trading partners."
1992,"• The tone of East Asian import demand, underpinned by rapid growth in domestic demand among the countries of Southeast Asia and by a pronounced 18 percent rebound in Chinese imports, remained firm. Trade among East Asian countries advanced by 17 percent (in dollar value) during 1991 after having increased by 15 percent in the previous year."
1992,"In the developing countries, regional merchandise-trade performance varied widely. Asia's export and import volumes, driven mainly by the dynamic performance of the"
1992,"leading exporters of manufactures and by robust intraregional trade, continued to grow, by 10.5 and 10.0 percent, respectively. Latin American imports increased by more than 10 percent, and exports climbed by 4 percent. Exports from sub-Saharan Africa turned upwards, increasing by 2.5 percent, representing a significant improvement over the 4.1 percent decline in the previous year; slumbering imports also wakened, increasing by 2 percent. Exports from the Middle East and North Africa declined sharply (by 15 percent), as a result of the Gulf crisis and falling oil prices; imports declined dramatically (by 12 percent). The trade volume of Central and Eastern European countries continued its steep decline."
1992,"Growth in industrial-country trade was meager: Japan's exports grew at an average rate of 3 percent, while exports from member countries of the European Community (EC) grew at"
1992,"In the Uruguay Round of the multilateral trade negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), agreement continued to elude negotiators, and the outcome remains in doubt. Not all aspects of the Draft Final Act satisfy all the objectives of the participants or the ambitions for a liberalization of trade that marked the Punta del Este Declaration. However, in mid May, agreement on a new European farm policy, involving substantial cuts in grain-price supports and lower production ceilings, was reached by the European Community, providing a more positive atmosphere for negotiations. Even if"
1992,"agreement were reached, much would remain to be done to secure open markets that offer countries the full benefits of specialization through trade."
1992,"However, commitments are in prospect to reduce tariffs on goods by at least 30 percent, lower export subsidies and domestic-support levels in agriculture, eliminate quantitative restrictions on textiles and clothing, eliminate voluntary export restraints, and open up market access for services. The beneficial economic effect of trade liberalization on developing countries is difficult to quantify precisely, although a number of studies have attempted to do so. Even the most modest estimates of the gains that developing countries would enjoy from industrial-country trade liberalization point to an amount at least equivalent to the approximately $50 billion that industrial countries transfer to developing countries annually as official development assistance."
1992,"Not all developing countries would benefit to the same degree from multilateral trade liberalization. Some food-importing countries are concerned that trade liberalization in agriculture would increase prices and lead to a deterioration in their terms of trade. To the extent that this may occur, net food-importing countries may require financial or other support while they adjust to new relative prices. Some countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean, fear that multilateral trade liberalization would narrow or eliminate their preferential trade margins, leading to a reduction in their exports. Again, some countries may require transitional support for adjustment."
1992,"In general, however, the economic benefits from a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round would be considerable for both industrial and developing countries. Failure would make it politically difficult for those developing countries that have undertaken trade reforms, or those considering such actions, to continue down the road of liberalization."
1992,"Whatever their justification, regional trade arrangements are a significant part of the international trading environment. With the important exception of Japan, most GATT members belong to some form of preferential trading scheme. Countries included in the two largest proposed free-trade areas—the European Economic Area and the North American Free Trade Area—would collectively account for 65 percent of global imports and 47 percent of developing-country exports."
1992,"Although multilateralism need not be threatened by regional groupings, there is heightened awareness of the risks of the new initiatives. By definition, regional arrangements, which provide particular advantages to member countries, can be discriminatory; only nondiscriminatory trade, however, fully ensures that maximum benefits from trade accrue to all parties. In addition to diverting normal patterns of trade, inward-looking regional arrangements threaten to divert investment and technology transfers that might otherwise have gone to nonmembers. Another fear is that an expansion of membership in arrangements with protective features may intensify, rather than attenuate, restrictions. Experience has shown that there are clear limits to the progress that regional arrangements can make in liberalizing the most difficult and most heavily protected areas. Concern has been expressed, too, that the diversion of effort from multilateral trade negotiations could weaken prospects for their success—even if the political will to reach an agreement exists."
1992,"The risks associated with regional trading arrangements can be avoided if the arrangements maintain an outward orientation. Ideally, they should lower trade barriers against non-members and eliminate all internal trade barriers as quickly as possible. Where members of regional arrangements have erected high barriers to trade vis-a-vis nonmembers, these barriers should be reduced in order to minimize the potential for diversion of trade and a misalloca-tion of resources. In this connection, a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round would help to reduce the potential adverse effects of preferential trade arrangements."
1992,"Indonesia's poverty assessment, for example, recommended investing in labor-intensive export industries, stimulating nonrice crops and smallholder treecrops to diversify agricultural production, and expanding support services. It also recommended expanding access to social services for people living in outlying provinces. These recommendations are the basis of the Bank's assistance strategy, which aims to reduce trade and domestic distortions and to promote growth in the rural outer islands. In fiscal 1992, for example, the IBRD committed $87.6 million to help improve the incomes of some 161,000 farm families living on five outer islands through the provision of inputs, access tracks, extension, and training in support of the establishment or maintenance of smallholder rubber and coconut plots."
1992,"In sub-Saharan Africa, the Bank's poverty-reducing country-assistance strategies have had to be designed in the absence of full data and analysis. The Bank has supported adjustment programs that reduce explicit and implicit taxation of agriculture and shift the terms of trade in favor of the rural sector, that eliminate regulations restricting growth of employment and private investment, and that redirect public expenditures towards the social sectors and rural areas. Most investment lending consists of projects in primary education, health, family planning, and rural development. In this region, poverty assessments are necessary to confirm that these efforts are on the right track or to modify them if they are not."
1992,"These ""win-win"" policies—development policies that are good for the environment—will not be enough, however. Strong public institutions and environmental-protection policies are essential. There may be situations requiring tradeoffs between income growth and protection of the environment; these call for careful assessments of the benefits and costs of alternative policies as they affect both today's population and that of the future."
1992,"The overall scope and level of PSD activities in the Africa region expanded significantly during fiscal 1992. Adjustment lending emphasized regulatory and domestic-competition policy reforms, alongside a deepening of trade-policy reforms (in Cote d'lvoire, Zambia, and Zimbabwe); Bank-supported public-enterprise reform and privatization programs have been adopted or expanded (in Burundi, Cote dTvoire, Guinea, and Zambia, for example); support for private delivery of public services has grown to include vocational training (Cote dTvoire) and agricultural-marketing services (Guinea and Zambia); while hybrid PSD operations have combined policy reforms, strengthening of market-based support services, and financing to reestablish and deepen term credit markets (in Burundi and Uganda, for instance)."
1992,"Private-sector development was an essential part of the fiscal 1992 work programs in the East Asia and Pacific and South Asia regions, as well. India's significant progress toward liberalization and deregulation was facilitated by Bank studies on trade and financial reform, for example, and was supported by the Bank's first structural-adjustment loan to that country. To identify paths for reform and eventual privatization of some activities in China, the Bank has assisted with sector analyses of housing, land, and industry. The Bank also fostered direct privatization in the development of sectors previously reserved for the government through projects in Indonesia's telecommunications sector and Pakistan's hydrocarbon subsector. It also supported the preparation of broader privatization programs in Bangladesh, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and Nepal."
1992,"The data for Venezuela show an improvement in development prospects: In 1991, GDP grew by 9.1 percent, a figure that is among the highest in the developing world. Data for Costa Rica and, to some extent, Uruguay, suggest measurable improvements, particularly on the external front, which were dampened by the occurrence of adverse terms-of-trade shocks. The Philippines operation, in relative terms, was the smallest of the first five Bank operations, and the effect was less significant than was expected."
1992,The IBRD's liquid assets are invested exclusively in fixed-income instruments and are actively traded in various capital and money markets under stringent risk-management guidelines. The attendant portfolio-management activities are supported by a comprehensive risk-management and monitoring setup covering both credit risk and interest-rate risk. Trading performance is continuously measured against detailed market-by-market benchmark portfolios.

1992,"directly delivered activities during the year, compared with an average of 58 percent during the five-year period, fiscal 1985-89. In the area of macroeconomic management, EDI's initial focus on structural adjustment, foreign debt, and trade widened to include sectoral-adjustment and policy issues such as the role of public-sector institutions, private provision of public services, the enabling environment for private initiative, and the targeting of services to the poor."
1992,"Research priorities are derived from the program objectives determined by the Bank's senior management. During fiscal 1992, the areas of emphasis were poverty reduction; human-resource development; the environment, forestry, and natural resources; macroeconomic issues and management (adjustment, debt, trade, finance, reform of the public sector, and private-sector development); and infrastructure and urban development."
1992,"Most poor people in developing countries live in rural areas; work on research devoted to estimating the tradeoffs among agricultural efficiency, poverty alleviation, and the environment was undertaken in fiscal 1992. Meanwhile, research on urban poverty is investigating the effects of deteriorating urban infrastructure and changes in social-sector programs on the poor; it identifies constraints on the productivity of the urban poor in the informal sector and proposes ways to relieve those constraints."
1992,"The environment. World Development Report 1992 focuses on the links between economic development and the environment. It explores policies that have negative economic and environmental results and provides evidence on the positive economic and environmental returns to land titling for poor farmers, to improved water and sanitation systems, and to research and extension services. It also analyzes those areas in which there are tradeoffs between growth and environmental preservation and demonstrates the need for careful and objective assessments of the relative costs and benefits of such policies."
1992,"Macroeconomic issues and management. The Bank's experience with adjustment programs, debt-reduction strategies, and trade-liberalization policies is being reviewed and adapted for use in countries in transition from centrally planned economies. Research is exploring the microeconomics and macroeconomics of enterprise reform in Central and Eastern Europe; the microeconomic aspects of"
1992,ownership reform and foreign trade in Eastern Europe; industrial reform and productivity in China; legal reform in Central and Eastern Europe; labor-market adjustment in Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia; and reform in African countries that once were socialist.
1992,"Further research was undertaken on the lessons of experience with alternative trade strategies. Regional trade arrangements have emerged as potential alternatives to international agreements, and research studies are focusing on the North American Free Trade Agreement, specifically, as well as assessing, more generally, the prospects and problems of regional strategies. The effects of trade restrictions adopted in reaction to environmental issues have been analyzed; evidence from the study shows clearly that such action produces high economic costs and relatively limited environmental benefits."
1992,"In calendar 1991, sixteen freestanding technical-assistance projects were approved for a total of $241 million. Among these were the first technical-assistance operations in Bulgaria, Angola, and Mongolia. The $17 million technical-assistance loan to Bulgaria will finance multiseetoral activities in support of the government's economic-reform program. These activities include private-sector development, bank restructuring and reform, human-resource development, energy-sector strategy reforms, and institutional development in the areas of trade, debt strategy, and statistics. In Angola, the $23 million Economic Management Capacity Building Project seeks to strengthen the government's ability to formulate and implement sound economic policies and investment projects by providing technical assistance and training for human-resource development, economic statistics, legal assistance, public-resource management, and liberalization policies. In Mongolia, a $5 million technical-assistance project will help the country develop institutional capacity for macroeconomic management in a market economy and define strategies for sectors and subsectors key to the country's economic development."
1992,"The IDS also underscores the growing international commitment to sustainable development. Given their resource and poverty constraints, however, developing countries face difficult tradeoffs in implementing environmental policies. The Bank continues to play an important role in the international effort to help developing countries integrate such policies in national development strategies, thus strengthening the link between environment and development. Increasingly, the Bank is expanding its cooperation with other concerned multilateral institutions, in particular, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), on international initiatives such as the implementation of the funding mechanism of the Montreal Protocol and the Global Environment Facility."
1992,"In Cote dTvoire, largest of the CFA countries, significant moves in the direction of democratization were accompanied by episodes of social unrest. Gross domestic product declined for the fifth year in a row; the decline in 1991 was about 2 percent. The protracted recession was mainly the result of a 40 percent decline in the terms of trade between 1986 and 1990, combined with a substantial appreciation of the real effective exchange rate, which has undermined the competitiveness of the Ivorian economy. In this difficult environment, however, there were some recent positive develop-"
1992,"tion. The average per capita income of $340 in 1990 is exceeded by all the world's regions except for South Asia, and only five current Bank borrowers (Botswana. Cameroon, Congo, Gabon, and Mauritius) qualify for IBRD (only) lending. Recent estimates indicate that the intensity of poverty is increasing, with average incomes of the poor falling further below the poverty threshold. This deterioration is due to both external factors (mainly the continued decline in the region's terms of trade) and internal factors (drought, civil strife, and inappropriate policies)."
1992,"Poverty-conscious structural-adjustment programs. Any sustainable effort to reduce poverty in Africa needs to be based on efforts to raise overall growth and incomes. Policy issues related to achieving both growth and poverty reduction are being addressed in adjustment programs (with a view toward shifting internal terms of trade toward the rural sector and reducing income differentials between rich and poor households within the urban sector, for example). Where feasible, analyses of the effect of public-expenditure programs on poor households across sectors are being carried out, and public-expenditure programs more beneficial to the poor are being encouraged."
1992,"At the beginning of 1991, there were reasons to temper the optimism usually associated with the region. Growth of world trade, which is so crucial for the outward-oriented economies of East Asia, was slowing. Growing protectionism in some industrialized countries and slow progress in the GATT negotiations were matters of serious concern. China's austerity program was in full swing, and efforts continued to address the overheating of the economy witnessed in previous years. After three years of double-digit growth, the economies of Malaysia and Thailand were beginning to display signs of overheating and of supply-side bottlenecks, particularly in the area of transportation and in the availability of skilled labor. Both countries were affected by the uncertainties about energy prices that accompanied the Gulf crisis. Despite Indonesia's successful adjustment in the 1980s, concerns over macroeconomic stability, based largely on the rapid private-sector response to structural reforms that led to a surge in imports and investment, were beginning to reemerge. The Philippines had been severely affected by a string of natural disasters and by the Gulf crisis through a drop in workers' remittances from the Gulf area and an increase in oil prices; in the Republic of Korea, rapidly rising labor costs were eroding its export competitiveness; and in Papua New Guinea, recessionary pressures, which had begun in the wake of a sharp decline in output in 1989, had not yet eased."
1992,"impressive than in 1990. Malaysia and Korea led the way, with GDP growth rates of 8.8 percent and 8.7 percent, respectively. China, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and Thailand were close behind, with rates of growth ranging from 6.4 percent to 8.2 percent. Inflation was in single digits for all these countries. Even in a year that saw little growth in world trade, these six countries experienced double-digit growth in export volume."
1992,"The response of the East Asian countries to the sluggish growth of world trade was another example of their flexibility. Growth in world trade in 1991, of 3.0 percent, was down sharply from 5.0 percent in 1990. The United States, the biggest market for East Asian products, was in recession, and U.S. imports from the region in 1991 rose by only 7.3 percent, much lower than the historical average. Neverthe-"
1992,"less, the region managed to achieve an impressive growth rate of exports (in excess of 10 percent) by increasing intraregional trade. Moreover, this restructuring of trade was done largely in a market-oriented manner without creating regional preferences or erecting institutional barriers to external trade. For longer-run sustainability of export-oriented growth, increasing attention is being given to special measures to promote trade and investment. At a recent summit of heads of government of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),' an agreement was reached to form an ASEAN free-trade area (AFTA) and virtually eliminate tariff and nontariff barriers for goods (except for nonprocessed agricultural products) traded within ASEAN over a fifteen-year period."
1992,"small Pacific island countries present a special problem and were the subject of a regional study by the Bank (see Box 6-2). Although Papua New Guinea achieved a high rate of growth in 1991 (7.8 percent), it faces continuing difficulties in staying competitive as its mineral income puts upward pressure or wages beyond improvements in labor productivity, which is constrained by inadequate skills and infrastructure. The Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Myanmar, and Viet Nam had only moderate growth in per capita income. Mongolia's trade was disrupted by the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and, as a result, the economy experienced severe difficulties."
1992,"By the standards of the broader developing world, the external environment for the six Pacific island countries was relatively favorable in the 1980s, and the terms of trade, though volatile, remained roughly unchanged over the decade. : These countries benefited from high levels of external assistance, enabling them to cover their domestic-resource gaps, maintain high investment levels relative to GDP, and avoid heavy-external debts. Notwithstanding these favorable factors, a number of impediments slowed their economic growth: First, these countries suffered from frequent natural disasters, with consequent adverse impact on economic growth. Second, political developments in some countries disrupted economic performance. Third, most investments concentrated on building economic and social infrastructure, with limited output gains in the short term. Finally, private investment in the productive sectors was exceedingly weak, owing partly to the lack of a supportive policy environment and an absence of dynamic growth strategies."
1992,"the exception of Mongolia, these policies stimulated a good supply response in 1991. Different policies have been adopted on price reform, however: China is following a two-track approach, keeping part (declining over time) of production at government-determined prices and allowing market forces to determine prices for the rest of production. Mongolia has declared its intention to liberalize the prices of most commodities and to deregulate its trade and distribution systems. Lao PDR and Viet Nam have implemented programs of radical price liberalization that have freed virtually all"
1992,"In Mongolia, the government's reform program was launched in the face of several external shocks: a sharp decline in Soviet aid, collapse of trade among members of the socialist trading block, poor market conditions for Mongolia's main hard-currency exports— cashmere, wool, and leather products—and a poor harvest. These shocks contributed to a sharp deterioration in Mongolia's economic situation. In 1991, external trade fell drastically, and shortages of key imported inputs, along with frequent electricity outages, led to a sharp decline in GDP. Government efforts to pursue a tight monetary policy were hurt by an inability to reduce the budget deficit in 1991, and, in stark contrast to decades-long price stability prior to 1990, inflation rates soared into the 120 percent-to-150 percent range."
1992,"In the other economies of the region, which accounted for 2 percent of the year's lending, Bank resources devoted to policy work are on the rise. In Viet Nam, projects are being prepared in several key sectors such as agriculture, transport, and education. Bank staff have worked with the Vietnamese government in preparing sector studies on agriculture and food; transportation; energy; education; population, health, and nutrition; and the financial sector. In addition, in collaboration with the International Monetary Fund, the Bank is advising the government on monetary, fiscal, and trade reforms. In Lao PDR and Mongolia, the Bank's role is a broad one, encompassing resource transfers, economic and sector analysis, policy advice, technical assistance, and training."
1992,"The external shocks brought into sharp focus major weaknesses in the region's economies in terms of lack of outward orientation of trade policies, weak financial sectors, restrictive labor markets, inefficient parastatals, and constraints on the private sector. In most countries, the structural-reform process, until very recently, had been slow and tentative, and, to a large extent, the economic and social transformation required for dynamic and sustainable growth remained unrealized. At the same time, the sustainability of macroeco-"
1992,"nomic imbalances increasingly became a major concern, as rapidly rising recurrent public spending tightened pressures on the banking system and the balance of payments. Managing the resource squeeze confronted governments with hard choices and tradeoffs. Cutbacks on subsidies and unproductive spending were typically constrained by political considerations and the difficulty involved in reducing private consumption."
1992,"Overall, there were hopeful signs in fiscal 1992 that South Asia's economies will emerge from the current wrenching changes better poised to deliver faster, sustained, and poverty-reducing growth in the 1990s. The fragility and sparseness of economic and social institutions continue to pose serious obstacles, however. In the weaker economies of Bangladesh and Nepal, limited implementation capacity exacerbates an already demanding situation. In all countries, the success of reform ultimately depends on governments' capacity to stay the course of economic stabilization and restructuring and to manage the inevitable difficulties in distributing the burden of adjustment among major socioeconomic groups. A more favorable external environment, in terms of favorable movements in terms of trade, continued access to capital flows, and further liberalization of trade, is also needed."
1992,"The new government swiftly implemented decisive macroeconomic stabilization and structural-reform measures. Within the first month in office, it devalued the rupee by 22 percent (in terms of rupees per United States dollar) and introduced a trade-liberalization package. A revised budget, which set as a target a reduction of the fiscal deficit to 6.5 percent of GDP, followed quickly."
1992,"Significant measures were taken to deepen reforms in trade and finance. Partial convertibility of the rupee was achieved. Virtually all capital transactions and most current-account transactions at free-market exchange rates have been permitted. Progress in trade liberalization is being realized through a major reduction in quantitative restrictions and some reductions in tariffs. In the financial sector, the"
1992,"There is, however, concern that some of these gains in poverty reduction may be eroded in the short run in the context of India's current adjustment program. Available evidence suggests that the poor remain highly vulnerable and may be adversely affected by a number of components essential to the reform package, including probable increases in basic food prices (which would follow in the wake of exchange-rate depreciation), reductions in subsidies for fertilizers and power, and short-term unemployment in the urban-manufacturing and service sectors (as firms adjust to increased competition following industrial and trade liberalization). While the government has taken steps to mitigate the effect of the adjustment program on the living standards of the poor, much more will need to be done in the near future, as a complement to the broader"
1992,"enterprise pricing, and industry and trade policy have been accelerated since late 1990. Financial-sector reforms have included improvements to prudential regulations, introduction of a market-based system for funding the government's domestic debt, the elimination of credit ceilings, and steps to reduce concessional and directed credit. Reforms in industry and trade have concentrated on a reduction in the maximum tariff and nontariff barriers to imports."
1992,"domestic and international competition provided the basis for a structural-adjustment operation, approved in fiscal 1992 in the amount of $500 million to support reforms in trade, industry, finance, and public-sector enterprises. In addition, about $650 million in undis-"
1992,"The countries of Central and Eastern Europe continued during the year to demonstrate their commitment to a thorough transformation of their economic systems within the context of parliamentary democracy and in the face of severe economic adversity. The transformation process is proceeding against the backdrop of massive terms-of-trade shocks resulting from the collapse of the previously dominant Soviet export market, and, for some countries, a heavy burden of external debt and external-financing shortfalls. The process of dismantling one economic system in favor of another involves macroeconomic stabilization and a reorientation of the role of the state; reform of incentives and price systems; enterprise reform and privatization; reform and development of the financial sector and banking system; the abolition of state monopolies on foreign trade, foreign exchange, and production; the installation of legal frameworks for the development of market economies; and the construction of social safety nets."
1992,"The external-trade shock, coupled with massive cuts in investment that reflected a hardening of constraints on the budgets of state-owned enterprises and the realignment of relative prices, led to large declines in real gross domestic product (GDP) in 1991 for the second consecutive year. Output declines ranged from about 8 percent in Hungary and Poland (notwithstanding the continued rapid growth of exports to the industrialized countries) to about 23 percent in Bulgaria, the country most dependent on the Soviet market and therefore the country most adversely affected by the demise of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA). Output declines in 1991 in Yugoslavia and Albania can only be estimated; surely, however, they were larger than Bulgaria's. In Yugoslavia, the out-"

1992,"needed for the governance of independent nations. Several factors make the task of transition more difficult than in Central and Eastern Europe. For all the countries (save for Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania), the longer duration of the communist legacy implies that a greater effort will be required to build the skills and institutions needed to make a market economy function. In most states, the question of whether and when to adopt a national currency has not yet been resolved: The difficulties associated with coordination of financial policies in what is still the ruble zone must be weighed against the lack of resources and institutional capacity needed to adopt separate currencies. Finally, for the smaller, natural resource-poor states (Belarus and Kyrghyz-stan, for example), the terms-of-trade shocks that are resulting from the move to world prices, together with the disruption of domestic production caused by collapsing interrepub-lic trade, are likely to be greater than those experienced in Central and Eastern Europe, given the republics' greater dependence on such trade in the past. Even an agriculturally rich and outward-looking republic like Georgia has been adversely affected by these economic uncertainties."
1992,"Against the background in 1991 of a decline in output by about 10 percent, inflation estimated at 140 percent (notwithstanding pervasive price controls), a budget deficit in excess of 20 percent of GDP, and growing shortages of food, medicine, and fuel, the Russian Federation embarked on a decisive liberalization of prices, the exchange rate, and trade in January 1992. All but 5 percent of consumer prices were freed in a two-stage process that was completed in April 1992. Prices on energy products, however, are expected to reach world levels more gradually. Imports were almost completely liberalized, and an interbank foreign-exchange auction began to function, with foreign exchange available for imports and profits remittances."
1992,"While Russia is the largest of the republics of the former Soviet Union and has moved more rapidly than most with a program of economic reform, other republics are also engaged in the difficult process of reforming their economies. In its dialogue with the Bank and the International Monetary Fund, Ukraine is drawing up a reform plan that will be discussed in parliament. At the same time, the Bank is helping Ukraine improve its institutional capacity through the provision of technical assistance. The republics of the former Soviet Union, in varying degrees, are aware that the outcome of the Russian stabilization and reform effort will influence greatly their parallel efforts, particularly with respect to inflation. Most followed the Russian example by liberalizing prices in January 1992, in part to avoid the outflow of goods to markets where prices were freed. Despite such price liberalizations, nearly all the states erected export barriers to interre-public trade to prevent the outflow of scarce commodities. This action, coupled with the declining use of the ruble (and the increasing use of barter), is expected to result in sharply lower levels of such trade in 1992. The resulting disruption to production and the almost total lack of foreign exchange in several states tended to exacerbate the shortages of food, medicine, and critical spare parts and contributed to a substantial decline in output."
1992,"with (a) the remnants of a centrally directed economic system in which both production and trade tended to be more advantageous to the center than to that of the successor states of the Soviet Union; (b) a large state-owned sector characterized by widespread inefficiency, technological obsolescence, and excessive backward integration; (c) a distorted industrial structure that favors heavy industry and military production over consumer and civilian goods and services; and (d) the virtual absence of private enterprises and a competitive environment. A number of states have made enterprise transformation a basic objective of reform and are attempting to establish the legal and institutional framework needed to achieve this goal. Their immediate need is for substantial amounts of technical assistance to help design the basic framework and policies and, subsequently, to initiate implementation."
1992,"In addition, action plans are being developed under proposed rehabilitation loans to establish clear understandings with all states on the direction, pace, and content of their reform programs as a basis for further support. The action plans also seek to establish policy understandings on issues such as price, trade, financial-sector, and legal reforms; sector-specific reforms in areas such as agriculture, energy, and housing; improved social safety-net arrangements during the transitional period; and training programs and institutional reforms. In all cases, the Bank is working closely with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and other major donors to coordinate the assistance that is being offered."
1992,"Several countries in the region added to ongoing reform programs by taking major policy steps during the past year. These reforms included changes in trade regimes, tax reforms, and improved programs in the social sectors."
1992,"the average import tariff from 32.2 percent in 1990 to 14.3 percent as of July 1993. Colombia's program of tariff reduction—in which average tariffs have been reduced to 15 percent from 44 percent in 1989—was completed three years ahead of schedule. Trade reform in that country was also extended to the agricultural sector, where quantitative restrictions on imports were virtually eliminated and a system of variable tariffs was introduced for key agricultural products. Most import tariffs in Honduras were adjusted to the 5 percent-to-30 percent range, while import permits and foreign-exchange allocations have been eliminated. Venezuela's program of tariff reform was also completed three years ahead of schedule. Prior to 1989, maximum tariffs in Venezuela were 135 percent; in 1991, the maximum stood at 40 percent, and the government is committed to reduce tariffs on nonagricultural imports to the 10 percent-to-20 percent range by the end of 1992. In Jamaica, foreign-exchange controls affecting capital transfers were removed."
1992,"When the present government of Nicaragua came to power in April 1990, it was faced with a country in economic ruin from a ten-year civil war and a bureaucratic apparatus that controlled almost every facet of economic activity. A major reform program, launched in March 1991, included a 400 percent devaluation of the cordoba and a package of policies aimed at fiscal and monetary austerity. The public-sector deficit was brought under control by reducing current expenditures, particularly those for defense and internal security. Public-sector monopolies in trade and marketing were abolished, and full access to foreign exchange by the private sector was established. Public employment was reduced, the tax system was overhauled, and privatization of about one third of 350 public enterprises was completed. The implementation of this reform program has received support from the Bank and other official donors through the mechanism of a consultative group chaired by the Bank. In September 1991, Nicaragua cleared $223 million in arrears owed to the Bank; shortly thereafter, a $110 million economic-recovery credit was approved—the first commitment by the Bank to the country since 1982."
1992,"The past year has seen further development of regional trading agreements in the Americas. Attempts at regional integration in Latin America are not new. There is, however, a significant qualitative difference between past experiences and the current initiatives. In the past, most regional trading arrangements were based on the erection of high tariff barriers against imports from nonmember countries and were basically oriented toward the promotion of regional import substitution. This inward orientation clearly limited potential gains, and most of these arrangements eventually collapsed. Today, tariffs are being lowered, and quantitative restrictions are being lifted as part of countries' individual structural-adjustment programs. Thus, the potential for lasting agreement on free-trade accords is much better. The slow progress and uncertain outcome of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations have also increased interest in organizing regional arrangements."
1992,"Mexico is currently negotiating a free-trade arrangement with the United States and Canada, which would be known as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The major issues to be resolved include the pace of adjustment necessary in Mexico's agricultural sector, which, on the one hand, would benefit from greater access to U.S. markets for fruits and vegetables, but, on the other, would face more competition from imported foodgrains. Other important issues include local-content rules for automobiles, environmental protection, safeguards against dumping, subsidies, and rules restricting access to Mexico's financial-services market and oil/petrochemical resources. The NAFTA is the first of what could possibly be a series of free-trade arrangements with the countries of the hemisphere and the United States under the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative. As of June 1992, thirty-one of thirty-four countries had signed framework agreements with the United States that establish bilateral commissions on trade and investment, designed to guide the consultation process leading to free-trade agreements."
1992,"In June 1991, the governments of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay ratified the Treaty of Asuncion, under which a common market (MERCOSUR) will be established. Under this treaty, all customs duties and nontariff barriers between member countries are scheduled to be phased out and eliminated by the end of 1994,1 and a common external tariff and common trade policy will be established. The treaty also pro-"
1992,"In addition, the five countries of the Andean Pact (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela) have agreed to move toward a regional free-trade arrangement during the period 1992^-95. The goal of the Andean Group is one of economic integration, including regional free trade, a common external tariff, and a coordinated regional approach in other areas. However, recent negotiations have proven difficult, and progress toward these goals is now stalled."
1992,Bilateral and trilateral discussions are also taking place: Mexico is negotiating limited trade-liberalization arrangements with Venezuela and Colombia; Chile and Mexico have signed a bilateral free-trade agreement; and Chile is negotiating arrangements with Venezuela and Colombia.
1992,"The region's only operating trade arrangement is the Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM), which has been in existence since 1973. During 1991, the CARICOM. countries reached agreement on a new common external tariff, which has generally been accepted by most members. However, the new tariff has a range of ©percent to 45 percent, with high duties reserved for goods that compete with domestic producers within the CARICOM. thereby encouraging a rather costly regional import-substitution regime. In addition, many members have added temporary surcharges and stamp duties to the basic common external tariff, further raising protection for certain industries. The high maximum rate of the tariff is out of line with maximum tariffs elsewhere in the region, and discourages extra-regional exports. CARICOM members are now considering the possibility of reducing theircom-mon external tariffs in order to improve resource allocation and accelerate export diversification."
1992,"The Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic Development (CGCED) continues to be the dominant forum to discuss the economic policies and development needs of the Caribbean countries with the donor community. The eleventh meeting of the CGCED, held in June 1992, reviewed priority country and regional economic issues that are likely to confront the recipient member countries of the Caribbean Group over the next two to three years. Major issues facing the group include the potential impact from a loss in preferential trading arrangements, declining aid flows, and the need for further reform in reciprocal trade arrangements and to foster efficiency in resource use."
1992,"In 1991, economic developments in the countries of the region were largely shaped by the Gulf crisis. Beyond the physical destruction inflicted upon the countries directly involved, other countries were hurt by trade disruptions, a fall in tourism receipts, reduced aid flows (for some), and by a return home of migrant workers from the Gulf."
1992,"Tunisia was also adversely affected by the Gulf crisis. Foreign-exchange earnings from tourism fell by some 33 percent, and other exports dropped as a result of the disruption of trade between Tunisia and the Gulf countries during the first quarter of 1991. While exports"

The tax system has been made more efficient and equitable through the introduction of a value-added tax and a complete overhaul of the income-tax system for individuals and corporations. Further reforms, such as the liberalization of trade and the financial system, are actively being pursued. Indirect instruments in the form of central-bank interventions in the money market have been substituted for direct controls, and the range of financial instruments has been widened considerably. Preferential lending and rediscount rates have been raised and will shortly be eliminated altogether."
1992,"The Jordanian economy showed resilience in the face of the Gulf crisis, with GDP declining by 0.6 percent in 1990 and increasing slightly in 1991. But, as a result of the massive return of migrant workers from the Gulf, unemployment increased to more than 25 percent, and per capita consumption fell by 14 percent in 1991. On the positive side, a new standby arrangement was approved by the International Monetary Fund in February 1992; this was followed by a new debt-rescheduling agreement with the Paris Club and the release of the second tranche of the World Bank's Industry and Trade Policy Adjustment loan. In support of Jordan's adjustment effort, the Bank organized a financing tour of the donor community by Jordanian officials in April 1992. The donor response was generally positive, but it was clear that Jordan's medium-term financing requirements have not yet been met."
1992,"$275 million, supports the completion of trade reforms started in 1983. The loan could mark the end of World Bank adjustment operations in that country, as it is anticipated that balance-of-payments viability will soon be achieved. A similar outcome is in prospect for Tunisia. An Economic and Financial Reforms Support loan, approved during the year in the amount of $250 million, provides continued support to Tunisia's medium-term program of economic reforms and its maintenance of macroeconomic stability. In both these countries, future Bank lending will take the form of more traditional project and sector lending."
1992,"CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC: IDA—$25.8 million. The government's new agricultural strategy, which relies on producer groups as channels for the delivery of input and services to farmers, will be assisted through a project that aims at the institutional strengthening of the Ministry of Rural Development, the National Agricultural Research Service, and the National Agricultural Development Agency. Provision of a line of credit for financial assistance to fanners, traders, and communities is included, as is a program of rural infrastructure, consisting mainly of rural roads. Cofinancing is anticipated from"

1992,"TURKEY: IBRD—$9.2 million. The government will be assisted in its efforts to improve information, systems, and processes related to macroeconomic management through a project that will help finance investments by the Undersecretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade in a data-management system and in institution-building initiatives. Total cost: $28.1 million."
1992,"The largest source of cofinancing in fiscal 1992 continued to be official bilateral and multilateral development institutions, which, together, accounted for $8,872 million, or 67 percent of total cofinancing. Official cofinancing from Japan, mainly through the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund and the Export-Import Bank of Japan, continued to account for the largest percentage of support of Bank-assisted operations. This cofinancing aggregated $1,379 million equivalent for thirty-one projects approved in fiscal 1992, or 37 percent of total bilateral cofinancing. A sizable cofinancing contribution also came from the United States ($675 million) and Germany ($379 million). South Africa moved to fourth position, as a result of its support to the Highlands Water Project in Lesotho ($241 million). Large amounts of bilateral cofinancing also came from France ($209 million) and the United Kingdom ($190 million). Cofinancing with multilateral institutions totaled $5,157 million. Cofinancing with the Inter-American Development Bank ($1,958 million) continued to be the largest in this category, accounting for 38 percent of the total. Other increased cofinancing support came from the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development."
1992,"Cooperation with the European Community and with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). A new position in the Bank's European office was created in July 1991 to act as liaison with, and to monitor and analyze issues dealing with, the European Community (EC). A system of contact points has been established with the European Commission in Brussels. With the EC rapidly increasing the amount of aid it provides, effective cooperation with it has become increasingly important to the Bank."

1984,"The experience in the developing world during the past year varied greatly: Low-income countries in Asia, heavily dependent on agriculture, realized an increase in GDP of almost 8 percent. China benefited further from a series of internal reforms designed to make its economy more responsive to price signals, and India enjoyed a good harvest relative to the drought-plagued one of 1982, when there was a poor monsoon. Low-income African countries suffered a decline in income, despite some improvement in their terms of trade. Export volumes stagnated, a severe drought crippled large areas of the region, and political difficulties compounded economic problems in some countries."
1984,"New courses and seminars introduced in fiscal 1984 included those in Washington on technical and vocational education; in New York (with the United Nations Development Programme) on energy assessment and planning; in Kenya on railway projects and policies; in Thailand on planning, financing, and managing city growth; and in China on port projects."

1984,"In general, the countries of the East Asia and Pacific region have survived the deep and prolonged international recession better than most other developing countries. Although the growth rate of gross national product (GNP) in the five large market economies—Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand—was but half the average of the 1970s, at 4 percent a year during 1982-83, it was more than double the level of all developing countries combined. China, also, was able to maintain a relatively high growth rate, of over 6 percent yearly, during the last three years. Success has had its cost, however: In all East Asian countries except China, the real burden of external debt has grown substantially, although the burden is less than for most other countries at comparable stages of development. For these countries, much of the increase in"
1984,"In comparison with the five large market economies, China—because it is a marginal net exporter of fuel, is not burdened with accumulated debts, and runs a trade surplus—remained initially unaffected by the recession. In contrast, Papua New Guinea and the small Pacific-island nations have all been severely affected by the drop of world commodity prices. Kampuchea, Lao People's Democratic Republic, and Vietnam have recently suffered from drought and continue to experience serious security and political problems."
1984,"In China, vigorous growth continued in 1983; industry expanded at an annual rate of 10.5 percent, and growth in agriculture accelerated to 9.5 percent. These developments reflect the policies of structural adjustment initiated in 1979. Their objectives included an increase in the share of consumption in GDP, more rapid growth of agriculture, significant improvements in living standards, especially among the rural population, and increased and decreased shares of light and heavy industry, respectively. While these adjustment objectives were largely achieved, modification of the original measures was made in 1982 and 1983; the most obvious examples are an increase in the investment rate and higher growth of output in heavy industries."
1984,"In foreign trade, the impact of the world recession and other factors caused a slowdown in the growth of exports in both 1982 and 1983. The performance of manufactured exports, however, particularly machinery and equipment, has continued to be impressive. Reflecting earlier cutbacks in investment and tightened controls over imports of some products, imports declined sharply in 1982 before rising moderately in 1983, when China recorded a further trade surplus of $800 million, according to official estimates. Together with the trade surplus achieved in the previous year, China has been able to maintain a relatively low level of foreign debt, and its foreign-exchange reserves have increased."
1984,"Over the next five to ten years, China's investment requirements for the expansion of its transport infrastructure, for an increase in energy and raw materials production, for modernization of industry, and for maintaining adequate growth in agriculture will be very large. A great need also exists for expanded and improved vocational and technical training. The World Bank's lending program will reflect these priorities; at the same time, the Bank will support the efficient utilization of resources both in the projects it finances and in the economy as a whole."
1984,"CHINA: IDA—$100 million. Financial assistance will be extended to a project consisting of the new planting and replanting of40,000 hectares of rubber on state farms and communes in Guangdong province. In addition, windbreaks will be planted in typhoon-prone areas, transport and agricultural machinery modernized, timber-processing facilities upgraded or constructed, and technical assistance provided. Total cost: $301 million."
1984,"CHINA: IDA—-$50 million. Funds will be channeled through the Agricultural Bank of China to collective units, individual farmers and households, and state-owned enterprises for investments in citrus orchards and other tree crops, and for the development of aquaculture, livestock, and agroprocessing. Some 90,000 families are to benefit directly. Total cost: $142.4 million."
1984,CHINA: IBRD—$105 million; IDA—$70 million. The China Investment Bank will be developed further through a second industrial-credit project that will help finance investment loans for small and medium-sized industrial projects in need of foreign exchange.

Cofinancing commitments (grant aid) have been secured from Norway ($11.6 million), the ADAB ($7.1 million), and CIDA ($200,000). Export credits of about $41 million are also expected to be utilized. Total cost: $811.7 million. CHINA: IBRD—$100.3 million. The project will assist the government in exploring and evaluating the potential of the Karamay oilfield, evolving the optimum method of recovering heavy oil, and undertaking a study on utilizing gas from the South China sea. Technical assistance and training are included. Total cost: $753.5 million."

1984,"Increased production of high-quality training materials, for use by both EDI and cooperating institutions, is emphasized in the new Plan. To set and administer standards, a Training Materials Policy Committee was created. Production of new written materials during the year included some thirty course notes, fourteen project case studies, twenty exercises, and four collections of seminar papers. EDI also brought to fruition its first computerized policy-simulation model. Work was completed on eight new multimedia modules in the series of sixteen planned on water supply and sanitation. Eleven have been finished, of which three have been translated into Spanish and French. Finally, a number of revisions or translations of EDI books were published. The revisions were Economic Appraisal of Transport Projects and Compounding and Discounting Tables for Project Analysis. Translations were published of various works into Arabic, Chinese, French, and Spanish."
1984,The progress on meeting its macroeconomic objectives has shifted the focus of attention to some of the remaining systemic problems of the Chinese economy. Their solution will require great effort and would extend over a considerable period of time:
1984,"After three years of almost uninterrupted decline in growth and trade, the global economy improved somewhat in the past year, with the most notable feature being a stronger-than-ex-pected recovery in the United States. There remain, however, serious concerns in several areas."
1984,"In particular, world trade has not responded, as it did in previous post-recession recoveries, to the resumption of growth in the industrial countries. In addition, in spite of a halt in the decline of commodity prices, current projections indicate that, in the medium term, terms of trade of the developing countries will not reach the levels realized in 1980. Finally, although the extensive rescheduling of debt carried out in 1982 and 1983 appears to have met the immediate objective of avoiding defaults and consequent disorder in the financial markets, there is no indication that capital flows are likely to return to earlier levels. The massive overhang of external debt has grown even larger, and concern about the financial situation has been rekindled because of a renewed increase in international interest rates."
1984,"Strains persist in the international structure of trade and payments—with particularly serious implications for the prospects of growth of the developing countries. Faced with the need to reduce imports, the developing countries have been forced to reduce the level and alter the composition of their investments. Capital formation has been shifted toward the energy sector and economic infrastructure at the expense of the social sectors. Priority has been given to meeting current expenses, rehabilitating existing facilities, and completing ongoing projects. Particular attention has been focused on projects designed to generate or conserve foreign exchange at the expense of other types of investment and more domestically oriented programs. (Details of actions taken by developing countries during the past year are contained in Chapter Four: ""1984 Regional Perspectives"")"
1984,"uneven: The United States staged a strong recovery, of 3.4 percent. The year was characterized by a stimulative fiscal policy and some easing of monetary policy (in the early part of the year), declines in personal savings, a slowdown in the rate of destocking. and huge increases— of almost 40 percent—in housing construction. The average annual growth rate of 3.4 percent actually understates the strength of the recovery; from the fourth quarter of 1982 to the fourth quarter of 1983, GDP increased by 6.2 percent. Recovery was accompanied by a large capital inflow, as the US current-account deficit increased from SI 1 billion in 1982 to $43 billion in 1983. Japan achieved a growth rate of 3.0 percent, despite a successful effort to reduce the size of its budget deficit relative to investment and GDP. Foreign trade provided a strong stimulus. In the Federal Republic of Germany. GDP increased by 1.3 percent. The expansionary effect of reductions in personal savings was balanced somewhat by a further decline in the central-government deficit relative to output. Recovery continued in the United Kingdom in 1983. with GDP growth averaging 3.0 percent, supported by a sharp reduction in the personal-savings ratio, an increase in residential investment, and an increase in stocks. Growth in France was only 0.4 percent, while GDP declined in Italy, as both countries pursued relatively tightened policies in response to high rates of inflation."
1984,"3 With a few exceptions, the data for developing countries presented in this chapter cover a sample of ninety countries. The historical data, therefore, may not agree with other data sources which attempt to make estimates for the universe of all developing countries. A sample has been used because many developing countries do not have a complete set of historical accounts. The sample includes all countries for which a rciiable set of balancc-of-payments. national-income accounts, trade, and debt data is available. For most data categories, the sample countries cover more than 90 percent of the total."
1984,"Despite the improvement in the external environment in 1983, GDP growth in developing countries continued to decline, falling to 1.0 percent, or well below the 1965-80 average and below the rate of population increase. A number of factors were involved. Depending on the particular commodity or good exported, increases in demand from industrial countries can affect the exports of developing countries with some lag; thus, although exports of developing countries did recover somewhat in 1983, the rate of increase was slightly below the 1965-80 historical average despite stagnation in the period 1979-82. However, for the first time since 1980, the terms of trade of nonoil developing countries improved—the result of improved prices for their exports and declines in the prices of oil and manufactured imports. The terms of trade of oil-exporting developing countries continued to decline, however. Real interest rates averaged 14.8 percent in 1983, if export prices are used as the deflator. As a consequence of continued high interest rates, a significant proportion of foreign-exchange receipts"
1984,"The experience in the developing world during the past year varied greatly: Low-income countries in Asia, heavily dependent on agriculture, realized an increase in GDP of almost 8 percent. China benefited further from a series of internal reforms designed to make its economy more responsive to price signals, and India enjoyed a good harvest relative to the drought-plagued one of 1982, when there was a poor monsoon. Low-income African countries suffered a decline in income, despite some improvement in their terms of trade. Export volumes stagnated, a severe drought crippled large areas of the region, and political difficulties compounded economic problems in some countries."
1984,"The fear that trade might be disrupted as a result of the Iran-Iraq conflict may have increased the spot price at times over the past year. The market is now undergoing significant changes; the oil-trading system is switching from longer-term to shorter-term contracts, and dependence on the spot price, rather than the official price, is increasing. Hence, considerable"
1984,"Debt and financing. The current-account deficit (excluding official transfers) of developing countries increased from $69 billion in 1980 to $98 billion in 1982. Most of the rise in the deficit was financed either by private flows or reserve drawdowns, as official flows changed little over the period. As a result, the medium-term and long-term external debt outstanding and disbursed of developing countries rose from $425 billion to $538 billion over the period 1980-82.6 This build-up of debt resulted from a surge in borrowing in 1981. In that year, many developing countries attempted to maintain the growth of imports at a time when interest rates were high and when, especially for the oil importers among them, terms of trade were falling precipitously. While net disbursements of medium-term and long-term loans fell from their 1981 peak of $70 billion, they were still at $55 billion in 1982. Apparently, many countries were willing to borrow large sums in 1981 (and to some extent in early 1982) in the expectation that the recession would be short-lived. High interest"
1984,"• Overall restraints on final demand were complemented (or in the case of the most successful among the adjusting developing countries, mostly in East Asia, rendered unnecessary) by successful attempts at import substitution and dynamic export promotion. Individual countries responded to the need to restrain demand in various ways; no matter what the response was, reductions in capital flows and increases in interest payments (particularly among the heavily indebted developing countries) meant that trade surpluses had to be realized. These surpluses have been offset by trade deficits in the industrial countries; trade deficits have thus become visible targets of complaints from export industries and industries that compete with imports from developing countries. Protectionist pressures have been mounting not only in labor-intensive manufactures, such as clothing and electronic consumer goods, but in steel and some primary commodities, as well. There would be an inherent contradiction be-"
1984,tween the financial pressure on borrowers to generate outflows of net resources and possible resistance in industrial countries against accepting a corresponding trade deficit.
1984,"Other, worrisome aspects of the international response to the events of last year were the lack of significant increases in official development assistance (ODA) and the refusal, by the industrial countries, to take action to reduce the restraints on the exports of developing countries. ODA decreased marginally in 1983, despite the greatly increased need for it. More distressingly, not only was there no progress in easing some of the trade restrictions that affect exports from developing countries (particularly the Multifiber Arrangement), but some countries actually raised further their barriers. A particularly notable example are the restraints, both formal and informal, that are being placed by a number of countries on Brazilian steel just as that country is making great efforts to increase its exports in order to repay banks in industrial countries. Pressures for further pro-"
1984,"One widely used means of discouraging imports and increasing exports and import substitution is to devalue the currency. Devaluation has the effect of increasing the local-currency price of tradeable goods, thus reducing the demand for imports and increasing the demand for domestic substitutes. In the many countries with overvalued currencies, the incentive to import (and hence borrow) increased; recent devaluations corrected a significant distortion in these economies."
1984,"Despite the tremendous difficulties involved in cutting expenditures, a number of major debtors have been successful in reducing their reliance on external finance. Indeed, many countries ran significant trade surpluses in 1983, indicating that they provided more physical resources to the world than they received. For example, the trade surplus in Latin America is estimated at over $30 billion for the year. And, in the aggregate, the trade deficit of all develop-"
1984,"Progress in the international dialogue was slow in the face of a prolonged recession affecting developed and developing countries alike. Issues of trade, debt, and financial flows, three matters that, in particular, have reflected the adverse international environment for developing countries, were the main themes of the dialogue. In various fora — the Development Committee, the Commonwealth meetings, and the nonaligned group—there were efforts to promote an international consensus on money, finance, and trade issues."
1984,"Development Committee meetings. In September 1983, the Development Committee met in Washington, DC, under the chairmanship of Ghulam Ishaq Khan, Minister of Finance, Commerce, and Economic Coordination of Pakistan. The Committee took note of the difficult economic situation facing the developing countries, as well as the importance of recovery in the industrial countries, and of increased capital flows of all types, to their development prospects. There was consensus among donors in support of a selective capital increase in the amount of approximately $8 billion for the World Bank. Proposals affecting the future role of the Bank, a topic currently under study by the Bank's management, which would include an examination of the implications for a general capital increase of the institution, were also welcomed. The need for a greater flow of concessional funds to the low-income countries, particularly through a seventh replenishment of IDA resources (IDA-7) at a realistic level, was recognized. The World Bank was asked to give particular attention to the problems of sub-Saharan Africa. On the subject of private investments, the Committee noted a proposal to increase IFC's capital by $750 million. The subject of trade and the promotion of development were discussed, and the Committee urged the reduction of a reliance on protectionism by all trading nations."
1984,"cused on IDA-7 and the linkages between trade and the promotion of development. All members but one expressed concern at the implications of a $9 billion replenishment for IDA-7, and all noted the urgent need for approval by governments of the implementing resolutions for the seventh replenishment and a selective capital increase so as to allow the legislative action to be completed in time for IDA-7 to become effective on July 1, 1984. Bank management and donor countries were urged by most members of the Committee to mobilize up to $3 billion in a supplementary funding arrangement so that these funds could become available by that date. A general capital increase for the World Bank would be kept in mind when the Bank's management puts forward proposals relating to the future role of the Bank at the September 1984 meeting of the Committee. On matters concerning the International Finance Corporation, early action was called for by the IFC board on a proposal by its management for a $750 million capital increase."
1984,"In its discussion on the linkages between trade, finance, and development, there was agreement in the Committee on the need for structural adjustment in both developed and developing countries and for the removal of trade barriers. The Committee concluded that trade liberalization and improved domestic economic policies, combined with enlarged flows of external finance, were required to accelerate the impetus of growth in developing countries. Indications of interest by governments in a new round of multilateral trade negotiations were noted, as well as the suggestion that at such a round, the question of dismantling nontariff barrriers and other measures affecting the trade of developing countries be considered. The Committee agreed that at future meetings, progress reached on improvements in trade opportunities, particularly for the developing countries, be discussed. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund were asked to continue their efforts to encourage an expanding and open world trading system."
1984,"Commonwealth meetings. The annual meeting of Commonwealth finance ministers took place in Port of Spain, Trinidad, in September 1983 under the chairmanship of George Chambers, Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Planning, Trinidad and Tobago. Discussions at the meeting focused on a report by the Commonwealth group of experts on the international financial and trading systems. Ministers agreed on the need for a more integrated approach to the interrelated issues of money, finance, and trade through a careful international process that could lead to an international conference. The report was commended to the Commonwealth heads of government meeting that was held in November 1983 in New Delhi, India. Commonwealth finance ministers also emphasized the importance of the role to be played by multilateral institutions and the need for these institutions to obtain adequate resources to expand their operations. Ministers agreed to play a positive role in the IDA-7 negotiations, taking into account the needs of an expanded IDA recipient community. Early agreement on a selective capital increase by the Bank to support an expanded lending program was also called for at the meeting."
1984,"In November, the Commonwealth heads of government, meeting in New Delhi, reviewed the global economic situation and how the problems arising from that situation might be resolved through action by the international community. Heads of government issued a ""New Delhi Statement on Economic Action,"" which noted that the economic situation called for a comprehensive review of international monetary, financial, and relevant trade issues. The statement added that a preparatory process of consultation was needed to identify areas requiring further consideration which could result in a consensus on the convening of an international conference."
1984,"Global negotiations. Discussion continued at the United Nations on the logistics and substance of the global negotiations on trade, energy, raw materials, development finance, and monetary issues. Two concepts were put forward at the last General Assembly session. One was a two-stage approach, which would focus first on immediate economic measures to be taken in the face of current economic difficulties; the first stage would then be followed by discussion of structural issues at a global conference, as suggested by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi at last year's Nonaligned Summit in New Delhi, and subsequently endorsed by the Group of 77 (G-77). A more specific and related proposal was the call for an international conference to structure an improved international monetary and financial system."
1984,"UNCTAD VI. Some 200 countries and agencies attended the meeting of UNCTAD VI in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in June and July 1983. Many were disappointed that the meeting arrived at no specific understanding on key issues such as market opportunities, commodity support, monetary and financial reform, technology transfer, and the securing for the developing countries of a greater share in international shipping. Others felt that the lack of progress reflected the current economic climate and argued that a more integrated and multipolar world economy required a different approach to global negotiations than that based on a static North-South concept. Member governments agreed, however, that UNCTAD should carry out a work program in matters related to these key issues, especially in the field of trade. Some OECD countries, in addition, felt that UNC-TAD's mandate needed to be clearly defined so as to consolidate and streamline its operations."

Taking part in the negotiations, in addition to the sixty-four signatories to the Lome Convention, are Angola and Mozambique. Negotiations must be completed in time for the new convention to come into effect by March 1, 1985. Among the major issues under discussion are the size of the European Development Fund (EDF), the introduction of the concept of policy dialogue in the development assistance provided by the Convention in light of its contractual nature, and a review of STAB EX—a scheme for the stabilization of export commodities and trade arrangements between the ACP and EEC countries."

1984,"Given the importance of global factors on the performance and policies of developing countries, in particular, difficulties in their capacity to service debt, analyzing the trade-offs implicit in choices between alternative policies affecting growth and welfare has become an important part of the research program. In April 1984, the Bank sponsored a major research conference on international debt issues as a prelude to further research work on debt issues."
1984,"The need for more effective policies that enable developing countries to respond to conditions and fluctuations in the international environment has prompted initiation of more projects on trade issues. The first in a series of major multicountry comparative studies on development-policy issues is a research project on trade liberalization, focusing specifically on the phasing and sequencing of trade-policy reforms. Based on evidence from about fifteen countries, the research will attempt to identify factors affecting the survivability of trade reforms, as well as their short-run costs and benefits. The principal objective is to develop policy prescriptions regarding the implementation of trade-liberalization reforms. Another study will look at nontariff barriers on developing countries' trade and the implications of those for the global economy."

Examples include the Environmental staff's work with UNEP, including active involvement with the Committee of International Development Institutions on the Environment (CIDIE), whose purpose is to harmonize and strengthen environmental policies and practices. For over a decade, the Bank has used a Trust Fund to conduct research on labor-intensive methods of construction; the results are now being applied in such countries as Honduras, India, Indonesia, and Kenya. For several years, a Special Public Works Program (SPWP) to develop effective methods of construction for capital-scarce, labor-abundant economies has been run by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the UNDP. A joint task force has now been established by the two agencies and the Bank, involving the Bank's agriculture, transportation, and water and urban-development departments, in order to integrate the technical findings of SPWP pilot projects (Kenya, Nepal, Rwanda) into Bank-assisted projects. Joint Bank-ILO (Technology and Employment Branch) work in Botswana, Kenya, and Malawi has led, also, to the refinement of labor-intensive methods of road building. The Bank has also worked with the ILO Expert Group on Poverty and Employment. Both operational and research departments have a wide range of contacts throughout the UN system, as well, including staff visits and consultations, information exchange on data and modeling, and attendance at meetings. Cooperation also exists with the International Trade Center (ITC) on export development, export promotion, and institution building and training; the United Nations University (UNU) on exchange of information and views on research prospects and on institution building, especially in Africa: and with UNCTAD on a range of trade and finance issues."
1984,"Cooperation with the European Communities was reflected by senior-level consultations with the Commission of the European Communities on development issues: Africa and food security, the prospects of Lome III negotiations, and the economic-policy dialogue with aid-recipient countries. Relations with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development are extensive and substantive, and cooperation extends into areas such as economic modeling, energy, international capital and trade flows, and development-assistance issues. With its representation in the meetings of the OECD's Development Assistance Committee (DAC), the Bank made a special contribution"
1984,The objectives of the short-term borrowing program (discount notes and the Central Bank Facility) are to achieve additional financial flexibility by gaining access to the growing markets for short-term instruments and their diverse customers and to reduce the overall cost of funds through lower-cost dollar borrowings. The IBRD's discount notes have been widely accepted as a premier credit and generally have been sold and traded competitively within the price range for the highest quality short-term securities. The IBRD's average cost of discount-note borrowings during fiscal 1984 was 290 basis points lower than the cost of the alternative borrowing— intermediate-term US-dollar bond issues.
1984,"The IBRD does not trade in any currencies for its own account. Adjustments arising from translation of currencies to US-dollar equivalents do not result in realized gains or losses as would occur with actual conversions into US dollars. Because of this, the General Reserve, rather than net income, is charged or credited annually with the amount of adjustment resulting from currency depreciation or appreciation. In fiscal 1984, the translation of currencies into US-dollar equivalents resulted in a debit to the General Reserve of $265 million, compared with $191 million debited in fiscal 1983."
1984,"intensified in a number of countries, but the bleak climate of both trade and aid represented a major obstacle against the implementation of adjustment policies that might lead to growth in production and expansion of exports. During the year, there was some faltering in the rate of growth of production and exports in several countries—Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mauritius, Somalia, Sudan, and Uganda."
1984,"Initial results, as measured by increases in production and exports in a number of countries—Kenya, Malawi, Mauritius, Somalia, Sudan, and Uganda—seem to provide evidence of some success for these policy-reform efforts. However, the beginnings of economic recovery in Somalia, Sudan, and Uganda have not so far made up for the many years of economic decline. In Kenya, numerous factors, including a shortage of foreign exchange, are inhibiting the implementation of reforms of the country's protective trade and industrial policy that are designed to improve the structure of industrial incentives. Mauritius also faces a difficult task in stimulating industrial production and exports and diversifying agricultural production."
1984,"In order to sustain economic recovery and growth, more remains to be done in implementing reforms of restrictive agricultural pricing and marketing policies and highly protectionist trade and industrial policies. Initiatives in these areas are expected to become stronger and include more countries in the coming years. The Bank's assistance through structural-adjustment and other policy-related lending, as well as through public-investment review and aid coordination, will also be strengthened. However, the experience to date of efforts at policy reform indicates that external economic circumstances are now a major constraint to any recovery and growth. Because adverse economic circumstances undermine attempts to expand exports, policy adjustments have so far only mitigated, not reversed, the economic deterioration in the countries of the region."
1984,"The adverse trade environment of Eastern African countries is unlikely to be reversed radically in the 1980s. The current economic recovery in Canada, Japan, and the US has not yet been matched in Europe. Nor are price prospects of Eastern Africa's export commodities bright. Even under optimistic assumptions about economic recovery in the industrial countries, prices of copper, coffee, cobalt, cotton, and sugar are not expected to increase in real terms by the late 1980s; in fact, they are likely to be lower than those prevailing in 1980 and about 15 percent to 20 percent lower than they were in the 1960s. As these commodities represent over two thirds of the region's exports, there is little prospect of any rapid expansion— as occurred in the 1960s—of traditional exports. While efforts are and should be made to diversify exports, the areas into which diversification might take place are not easy to identify, and market entry is difficult in times when"
1984,"world trade is expanding slowly, if at all. Diversification of a very narrow export base is a particularly formidable task for the least developed countries of the region. In the years to come, the countries of the region, in all probability, will still be in search of an engine of growth. Increases in external financial support on relatively concessional terms are thus critical for the implementation of policy reforms and for a resumption of growth. In this context, the recent stagnation of ODA levels is a matter of serious concern."
1984,"When the trade deficits of Eastern African countries rose sharply in 1974, as large increases in import (especially oil) prices exceeded the rise in export prices in the prevailing commodity boom, the international community responded to the urgent need for external finance: Member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) increased their aid considerably between 1973 and 1975; OPEC members did the same; the multilateral development agencies increased their commitments; and the IMF arranged oil facilities. Thus, between 1973 and 1975, ODA to Eastern Africa increased by 73 percent in real terms, and compensated, to a large extent, for the loss in terms of trade suffered during the first oil shock."
1984,"During the second oil price rise in 1979/80— notwithstanding the partially offsetting advantage of higher export prices for copper, coffee, and sugar—the region's increased trade deficit was again covered by increased amounts of aid, mostly ODA, which rose from $2.6 billion in 1978 to $4.4 billion in 1980, or by 34 percent in real terms. In addition, several bilateral donors"
1984,"In contrast with the 1970s, there has been no recent increase in ODA to offset the effects of the worldwide trade recession that began in 1980. In 1982, ODA to Eastern Africa amounted to S4.3 billion, indicating that absolute stagnation had taken place since 1980. The net flow of commercial loans to the region fell sharply at this time; it declined from about $950 million in 1980 to about $350 million in 1982."
1984,"The balance-of-payments situation remained critical throughout the region. While the terms of trade improved slightly for a few countries, for most, they deteriorated. Because international prices of coffee, cocoa, cotton, rubber, and groundnut oil improved over the past twelve to eighteen months, the balance of trade and current account of countries such as Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, and Senegal were affected"
1984,"In some cases (Ivory Coast, for instance), a sharp curtailment of imports, coupled with a slight improvement in the terms of trade, led to a large improvement in the balance-of-trade account. For most countries, however, declining export earnings and heavy interest payments on external-debt obligations resulted in large current-account deficits; thus, in Mauritania, for example, the deficit amounted to 40 percent of gross national product (GNP). Given reduced commercial and official capital inflows, most countries experienced overall balance-of-pay-ments deficits, financed by an accumulation of arrears on import payments and debt service or through a drawdown of reserves. Several countries were compelled to seek rescheduling of their debt payments through the London and Paris Clubs."
1984,"Nigeria—the dominant economy in sub-Saharan Africa—was in a state of financial crisis during most of fiscal 1984. Both the production and price of oil dropped sharply.3 As a result, export earnings and government revenues, as well as the external current account and the government's fiscal position, weakened dramatically. The capacity of the country to import dropped considerably as trade credits dried up under the impact of accumulated trade arrears. The drop in imports (28 percent in real terms) was equal to 5 percent of Nigeria's GDP and induced a decline in national income (7.4 percent in real terms). Manufacturing industry, highly dependent on imported inputs, saw capacity utilization drop to levels below 50 percent in some subsectors."
1984,"The Nigerian government responded to the crisis by adopting stabilization measures and sought the support of the IMF and the World Bank to address both the short-term difficulties and the underlying structural problems. There appears to be a broad measure of agreement between the government, the Bank, and the IMF on steps necessary to stabilize and restructure the economy. Trade arrears of about $4.9 billion to $5.4 billion have already been rescheduled. There remains an additional $2 billion to $2.5 billion in trade arrears to be rescheduled. Much progress has been achieved by the government and the IMF in working out the details of an Extended Fund Facility (EFF). In the meantime, the Bank approved a $250 million Fertilizer Import Project for Nigeria, which will provide support to the balance of payments, as well as significant fiscal adjustment, by reducing fertilizer subsidies and thereby increasing government revenues."
1984,"Senegal's economic and financial difficulties were compounded during the past year by the return of severe drought conditions; as a result, the economy is expected to experience a decline in overall production of between 2 percent and 3 percent. The adverse effects on the balance of payments and on consumption have been largely mitigated by a substantial improvement in the country's terms of trade and by the response of the donor community to Senegal's appeal for 150,000 tons of emergency food."
1984,"Substantial efforts are continuing to be made to adjust to slower growth in world trade, the quantum jump of energy prices after 1979, and high real interest rates. In the countries most severely hit by adverse conditions—Korea, Thailand, and the Philippines—the World Bank continues to support those adjustment efforts through lending for structural adjustment and through its Special Action Program. The struc-"
1984,"In comparison with the five large market economies, China—because it is a marginal net exporter of fuel, is not burdened with accumulated debts, and runs a trade surplus—remained initially unaffected by the recession. In contrast, Papua New Guinea and the small Pacific-island nations have all been severely affected by the drop of world commodity prices. Kampuchea, Lao People's Democratic Republic, and Vietnam have recently suffered from drought and continue to experience serious security and political problems."
1984,"The economy of the Philippines continued to be in severe difficulties during the past year. GNP growth slowed from its average rate of over 6 percent in the 1970s to less than 1 percent in 1983. This slump was caused mainly by weak demand for the country's major export products—such as copper, coconut products, sugar, and forest products—and by a severe deterioration in the terms of trade. The resulting adverse external conditi ons led to rising current-account deficits, which reached over 8 percent of GNP in 1983, and an increasing reliance on short-term credit. The debt-service burden (including interest on short-term debt) rose to 38 percent of export earnings by the end of 1982. At the same time, public revenues dropped precipitously, forcing a reduction in public spending, in particular, spending on public-investment programs. Spending cuts notwithstanding, the budget deficit grew to over 5 percent of GNP in 1983."
1984,"The rapid expansion of domestic demand spilled over into rising imports; at the same time, the volume of exports declined. The decline reflected, in part, increased domestic absorption, but, also, a poor harvest in 1983, an appreciating exchange rate, and the impact of international trade restrictions affecting selected major exports, including tapioca, sugar, tin, canned and frozen foods, and textiles. Given these trade developments, which were only partly offset by increased remittances from Thai workers abroad, the current-account deficit, which had dropped to 2.7 percent of GDP in the preceding year, rose again to over 5 percent. Higher imports, stable import prices, relatively unchanged public-service tariffs, nominal"
1984,"By early 1984, the government moved to control the expansion of domestic demand through measures to increase tax revenues, to restrain public expenditures, and to limit bank liquidity. As a result, and because of a good harvest, and with continued strengthening of commodity prices, Thailand's trade balance is expected to improve. However, the resulting current-account deficit is likely to remain in 1984 at about 4 percent of GDP, a level that is not sustainable over the medium term. Continuation, therefore, of structural-adjustment policies designed to achieve a sustainable external balance remains important."
1984,"In foreign trade, the impact of the world recession and other factors caused a slowdown in the growth of exports in both 1982 and 1983. The performance of manufactured exports, however, particularly machinery and equipment, has continued to be impressive. Reflecting earlier cutbacks in investment and tightened controls over imports of some products, imports declined sharply in 1982 before rising moderately in 1983, when China recorded a further trade surplus of $800 million, according to official estimates. Together with the trade surplus achieved in the previous year, China has been able to maintain a relatively low level of foreign debt, and its foreign-exchange reserves have increased."
1984,"Papua New Guinea continues to be subject to fluctuating and depressed commodity prices, in particular copper, which accounts for more than half of total exports, and coffee, the other major export. Despite an improvement in terms of trade in 1983, overall export-price levels remained some 30 percent below the 1979 highs, and are not expected to improve much over the next few years. The improvement in the balance of trade in 1983 was the result of an approximate increase of 25 percent in export volume, mainly of copper. This expansion in output, and a major surge in investments associated with the OK Tedi mining project, led to real growth of around 7 percent in 1983. Gross domestic product exceeded its 1979 level—the previous high watermark—for the first time."
1984,"While the economies of several South Asian countries expanded but slowly in fiscal 1984, others displayed considerable buoyancy. Most economies of the region, which are heavily dependent on the performance of their large agricultural sectors, benefited from generally good growing conditions and from the gathering recovery in the major industrial countries. Along with substantial gains in domestic economic activity, the external accounts of most South Asian countries suffered less strain than in the previous year or two; this, in part, was the result of comparative stability or even improvement in their terms of trade, increased receipts from both merchandise exports and migrant remittances, and prudent economic management. (An example of the last-mentioned factor is the steady progress towards reduced dependence on imported energy.) In addition, the region has benefited from substantial amounts of con-"
1984,"ports of textiles, clothing, engineering goods, and handicrafts accounts for much of the remaining increase. Improvements have been registered in India's trade balance, and the current-account balance continues to reflect these trends."
1984,"There has also been a significant turnaround in the balance of payments. Import demand has been relatively low, and the inflow of workers' remittances rose by almost 50 percent in fiscal 1983 before leveling off during the past year. The terms of trade, which had dropped by over 42 percent during fiscal 1981 and 1982 over the figure for the 1980 period, have recovered somewhat. In addition, the value of exports has rebounded as a result of relatively good world prices for jute, jute products, and tea. The substantial depreciation of the taka since 1981 has helped the growth of nontraditional exports, especially ready-made garments. There has also been an increase in aid disbursements, which had stagnated in the first two years of this de-"
1984,"Economic growth in the countries of the Europe, Middle East, and North Africa region continued to be constrained during fiscal year 1984 by the necessity to maintain—or, in some countries, to begin—the difficult process of adjusting their economies to the changed global economic situation. This process has been made more difficult by the prolonged reduction in international capital flows, both official and private, and by the continued poor performance of the agricultural sector due to adverse weather conditions. Countries that began the adjustment process early, Turkey and Hungary, for example, have been able to benefit from the start of the world economic recovery. Most of the countries of the region, however, are only beginning to develop suitable adjustment policies that will cut back fiscal deficits, lower inflation rates, and improve the balance of trade;"
1984,"While short-term economic adjustments have dominated the events of the year, there has been a growing awareness that many countries in the region require a fundamental restructuring of their economies if they are to expand at a rate that will satisfy the rising expectations of their rapidly growing populations. The short-term remedies—particularly cutting back on imports and public-sector investment — run contrary to long-term necessities: increased exports, greater domestic-resource mobilization, and above all, the creation of more job opportunities. Policy and institutional changes—investment planning focused on employment and exports, more efficient public-sector management, trade and price policies that provide incentives to genuinely economic activities and"
1984,"Despite the vigorous demand-management and trade-policy measures that have been in place since late 1981, Romania's GNP is reported to have grown by 3 percent in 1983, slightly lower than the 3.2 percent of 1982, but still high by international standards. The official forecast for 1984 is for a growth in GNP of 7 percent. On the other hand, significant changes in prices, especially for energy and basic foodstuffs, have resulted in an increase in consumer prices by about 12 percent in 1982 and 5 percent to 7 percent in 1983. (During the 1976— 80 period, prices inched ahead by less than 2 percent a year.) Drastic cuts in imports in both 1982 and 1983 led to a remarkable turnaround in the balance of payments. The current account in convertible currencies has gone from a deficit of $2.4 billion in 1980 to a surplus of $870 million in 1983. The government forecasts a surplus of about the same size in 1984 as a result of increased exports. Other structural changes introduced in the midst of the international recession are designed to ease the foreign-exchange constraint in the medium term. They include policies that place special emphasis on narrowing the energy gap, unifying the exchange-rate system for all commodity trade transactions, and raising the structure of interest rates to make it broadly positive in real terms. Despite these improvements, Romania again had to seek a rescheduling of its external debt in 1983."
1984,"A deterioration in the balance-of-payments and budget situation of Syria during the first part of the decade has been controlled by restrictions rather than by structural adjustments. Restrictions on imports were largely responsible for the reduction in the overall balance-of-payments deficit from $700 million in 1980 to $260 million in 1982. Control of government expenditures has reduced the budget deficit from 21 percent of GNP in 1980 to 16.5 percent in 1982. This has been accompanied by a reduction in inflation from 19 percent in 1980 to 14.5 percent in 1982. Nevertheless, as in the other countries, GNP growth has slackened, from 7 percent in 1981 and 1982 to 4 percent in 1983, with agricultural GNP falling as a result of drought. Large volumes of highly concessionary loans and of grants have enabled Syria to incur trade deficits without recourse to excessive external borrowings, and the country's debt-service burden has remained at about 13 percent over the last two years."
1984,"A number of short-term incentive and stabilization measures introduced in Egypt have curbed imports, restored the flow of workers' remittances, and cut the budget deficit. In addition, some changes aimed at encouraging, in the long term, foreign investment, industrial exports, and additional workers' remittances have been made in the foreign-trade regime and exchange-rate system. The rapid economic growth of recent years has been principally based on exogenous earning sources that have weak linkages to agriculture, industry, and services, where most of the labor force is employed. Continued economic growth, particularly employment creation, depends on expanding and diversifying the productive base of the economy and developing the considerable potential that exists in these sectors. The government realizes that substantial domestic policy reforms are needed, and the Bank is assisting in formulating some of the required reforms. The first of what is expected to be a series of loans to develop the export potential of the industrial sector was approved in fiscal 1984."
1984,"Jordan, although not a producer of oil, has also weathered the difficult past few years fairly well. Despite a 20 percent decline in foreign aid, stagnation in workers' remittances, and a drop in exports, the momentum generated by a decade of heavy investment and by a good year in agriculture sustained a GDP growth of about 5 percent in 1983. In addition, as a result of a reduction in imports, the current-account deficit has improved. Medium-term economic prospects remain satisfactory. Completion of a number of major export-oriented industrial projects should boost industrial production and exports. The country's trade deficit, however, is expected to rise unless workers' remittances and foreign grants increase. Given Jordan's relatively low foreign indebtedness, increased external borrowing should present no problems."
1984,"Uruguay (about 6.3 percent), and Mexico (4.7 percent). Adjusted for terms-of-trade losses (which, in 1983, fell an additional 7 percent for all of Latin America), per capita gross national income is now estimated to have declined in a number of countries to the level of the early to mid 1970s."
1984,"Confronted with a much tighter external-resource constraint stemming from adverse trade developments7 and a sharp, destabilizing reduction of capital flows,8 most Latin American countries cut imports and investment drastically. Investment in 1983 is believed to have been well below the level of 1981. Unemployment also reached unprecedented high levels. Despite these adjustments, almost all Latin American nations continue to experience severe financial problems and external-payments difficulties. Nutrition, education, housing, and health services, areas in which significant gains were made in the 1970s, all have suffered severe setbacks."
1984,"The adjustment in Latin America in 1983 was greater than that which took place in 1982 in terms of declines in investment, output, and employment and improvement in the region's external accounts. From a deficit in the trade balance of SI.6 billion in 1981, Latin America recorded an unprecedented $31.2 billion surplus in 1983 (4 percent of GDP), an amount more than three times the 1982 surplus. The massive surplus, achieved despite a decline in the value of exports, was the consequence of an enormous cut in imports, which, in just two years, have been reduced to half the level in 1981. Real devaluations in many Latin American countries appear to have enhanced the competitiveness of these countries' exports in 1983, but trade between Latin American countries, which grew rapidly in the 1970s, declined sharply as a result of reductions in imports."
1984,"7 The foreign-exchange loss caused by the deterioration in the terms of trade was $8 billion in 1981, $5.7 billion in 1982, and $7.1 billion in 1983 from an initial value of exports estimated at S96.8 billion. Growth of export volume declined from an average 8 percent in the 1976-80 period to an average 4 percent in 1982-83."
1984,"forms of trade policy and of agricultural-credit policy. A structural-adjustment loan to Jamaica, the second of its kind, aims at stimulating industrial and agricultural production for export. In Panama, the Bank's nonproject lending focuses on improving the efficiency of public-sector enterprises and on stimulating trade and agricultural output."
1984,"During 1982-83, Central America's economy deteriorated as exports and investments remained sluggish; real per capita GDP declined by over 10 percent. Private investment was adversely affected by the declining demand for exports, particularly intraregional trade in the Central American Common Market (CACM), the adverse political climate in the region, and the stabilization policies followed by some countries. Exports (including CACM trade) decreased in nominal terms by about 12 percent, owing mostly to lower exported volumes of coffee, bananas, beef, and manufactures. The terms of trade showed only a minor deterioration with respect to 1981 and continued to be sharply down from the peak period, 1976-78."
1984,"The Central American Common Market is confronting serious payments difficulties, which have resulted in a significant decline of intraregional trade. The scarcity of foreign exchange has prevented debtor countries from settling their balances in the CACM clearing house, and some countries have accumulated large balances in nonconvertible currencies owed by other CACM members. Since the import component of manufactured exports originates outside the area, creditor member countries are indirectly extending foreign-exchange loans to debtor member countries at a time when their balance-of-payments position is weak. Recent regional meetings have explored the possibility of obtaining a moderate increase in intraregional trade through an equitable distribution of the financing required by the debtor countries, including participation from external sources."
1984,"One particular adverse development of recent origin is the weakening of the regional trade-preference system, CARICOM (the Caribbean Community and Common Market), under the strains of the worldwide recession. Restrictions on imports in the larger countries."
1984,"particularly Guyana, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago, have resulted in significantly less trade inside CARICOM than was the case at the beginning of the decade. This circumstance, plus the need for a large proportion of assistance on concessional terms for these countries, emphasizes the importance to any future development of export expansion and diversification of the economic base. Work has proceeded for several years on shifting the focus of trade of these countries to extraregional markets. The CARICOM Council of Ministers, which rarely met during the first decade of the organization, but which has now agreed to meet annually to address the mutual problems of Community-states, will be considering proposals for a substantial reform of the regional trading system in the near future."
1984,"MOROCCO: IBRD—$150.4 million. The loan—the foreign exchange it provides will be used to finance imports—is in support of the first phase of implementation of the government's industrial and trade policy-adjustment program, whose principal aim is to introduce structural changes in the system of incentives so as to eliminate bias against export production, lower manufacturing costs, and hence lay the basis for a restoration of dynamism to the pattern of industrial growth."
1984,"TUNISIA: IBRD—$13.4 million. Consultancy services will be supplied to improve the efficiency of operations in the phosphate industry and to study the feasibility of new production facilities. In addition, technical assistance will be furnished the National Mining Office to help it improve planning and implementation of a rational mining-exploration policy. Cofinancing is being provided by the consortium, Mines de Potasse d'Alsace/Spie Batignolles ($3.1 million) and the US Trade and Development Program ($200,000). Total cost: $24.6 million."
1984,"SENEGAL: IDA—$7.5 million. Through construction of new infrastructure for container handling, rehabilitation of several existing port facilities, and technical assistance and training to strengthen the management and operations of Dakar port, freight costs for Senegal's external trade will be reduced and Dakar's position as a port of transfer for neighboring countries will be enhanced. Cofinancing is expected from the CCCE ($6.65 million) and the KFAED ($4.09 million). Total cost: $27.55 million."
1984,"KENYA: IBRD—$95 million. The construction of a rock and earthfill dam on the Tana river, along with associated civil works and electrical/mechanical equipment, is expected to help ensure a firm source of reliable electricity-generating capacity, develop indigenous renewable-energy resources (thereby reducing the country's heavy dependence on imported oil), and create new job opportunities. Cofinancing is anticipated from the AfDB ($21.7 million), the SFD ($11.5 million), and the Yugoslav Bank for International Economic Cooperation ($11.4 million). Total cost: $353.8 million."
1990,"There was a sharp decline in Asian GDP growth from 9.7 percent in 1988 to 5.1 percent, accounted for largely by India and China, which returned to more normal growth rates after experiencing exceptionally rapid expansion in 1988. The fast-growing East Asian economies also slowed down, partly the result of reduced demand for their exports and rising domestic cost pressures in some economies. The decline in output growth in the developing countries of the Europe, Middle East, and North Africa region was mainly a reflection of the significant dislocations occurring in Eastern and Central Europe. These dislocations resulted in stagnation of per capita incomes in the region in 1989, despite better performance in countries such as Algeria, Portugal, and Yugoslavia."
1990,"There were a number of important developments at the country level in 1989 (Table 2-9). The United States regained its position as the world's leading exporting country, after three years as number two behind Germany. This change resulted from two factors—a large increase in the volume of U.S. exports and a depreciation of the deutsche mark against the dollar—either one of which would have moved the United States into first place. Among the twenty-three largest exporters, three countries (China, Mexico, and Saudi Arabia) increased their rankings by two places relative to 1988. Two of these twenty-three exporting countries, Mexico and Saudi Arabia, experienced export growth rates that were more than double the 7.5 percent world average. Corresponding import growth rates show that five countries doubled the world average: Australia, Finland, Korea, Mexico, and Spain."
1990,"The focus on the poorest countries was endorsed,1 as was the practice of the previous replenishment to limit to 30 percent the allocation of IDA funds to the two largest active IDA borrowers (India and China). (See Figure 3-1 for IBRD and IDA lending to the poorest countries.) The deputies also recommended that, assuming performance continues to warrant it, the level of support to sub-Saharan African countries—currently between 45 percent and 50 percent—not be reduced."
1990,"The country coverage of the unit is wider than Eastern and Central Europe, and includes China, the Lao People's Democratic Republic,"
1990,"The need for such a focus is clear, particularly in the low-income countries, where the average educational attainment of the 25-year-old to 35-year-old age group is less than three years, where half the children of school age (China and India excepted) are not enrolled in school, and where fewer than 60 percent of the students who enroll in primary school complete the six-year cycle."
1990,"Forty-four of the fifty-six projects in the agriculture sector had environmental effects. Some of the recurrent environmental elements in agricultural projects are land and soil management and conservation, integrated pest-management techniques, wildlife management, protection and management of forests, rehabilitation of drainage and irrigation systems, institutional support, and research. Eight projects supported forestry protection and management (in the Central African Republic, China, Cote dTvoire, Guinea, Indonesia, Mexico, Morocco, and Zimbabwe). Projects totally focused on environmental issues were approved for Bolivia, Brazil, and Madagascar."
1990,"Analytical work is also under way on two other sets of issues in the area of public-sector restructuring. One concerns the lessons that can be drawn from the effects of privatization on efficiency, employment, and public finance and the extent to which experience is replica-ble. Recently completed studies include a review of Bank lending for divestiture, an assessment of reforms of ownership and control mechanisms in China and Hungary, and a case study of railway privatization. A second issue concerns the respective roles of the public and private sectors. A number of Bank and IFC studies undertaken during the past year have examined the private delivery of public serv-"

1990,"Two features of the recent Chinese experience stand out: First, there are clear limits to the pursuit of rapid growth; pass these limits and intolerable pressures are placed on prices, infrastructure, and supplies. Second, unfinished elements in the reform agenda can no longer be ignored if the economy is to resume a path of accelerated growth with relative macroeconomic stability. Thus, an austerity effort has been required in China—and implemented with considerable success in reducing the inflation rate. For enduring macrostability, however, China will need to tackle the difficult core of decisions that ultimately has to be faced by all centrally controlled economies moving to a more market-oriented system. The government has begun to prepare an agenda of short-term and medium-term actions that will establish a sound basis for strengthening macroeconomic policies and institutions, for further liberalizing prices and markets, and for enterprise and ownership reforms."
1990,"The region's impressive growth in the 1980s was no guarantee of equity, nor of social and environmental safeguards. Especially in parts of India, Bangladesh, and Nepal—but also elsewhere in Asia—growing landlessness and disproportionately little access to irrigation, electricity, and social services have perpetuated concentrations of deepest poverty and accentuated income and regional disparities. In China, growth in the 1980s has doubled the incomes of 800 million people, but changes in income shares between workers with fixed wages and industrial workers receiving bonuses have increased disparities in the urban sector, while regional pockets of poverty remain an important concern."
1990,"Commitments by the IBRD and IDA to the region in fiscal 1990 totaled $6,397 million, some $1,435 million less than the year before. The drop resulted mainly from declines in commitments to India and China of $1,096 million and $758 million, respectively. Commitments to the Philippines, of $942 million, increased by 90 percent over the previous year's total."

1990,"In order to develop a core environmental strategy, regional and country-related studies have focused exclusively on environmental issues. Thus, environmental studies have been undertaken in the past two years for China, India, Indonesia, Korea, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines so as to strengthen project development. In these tasks, priority has been given to issues of forestry, land management, and urban pollution. In the course of these stud-"

Improvements in selected existing vocational and technical-education (VTE) schools and teacher-training institutions will be supported, VTE research and development centers will be created, and the management capability of the VTE system will be strengthened. Cofinancing is anticipated from the Federal Republic of Germany ($7 million). Total cost: $91 million."
1990,"CHINA: IDA—$30 million. Some 175,000 people, most of them poor, are expected to benefit from a project that will reconstruct or rehabilitate housing, buildings, classrooms, rural health facilities, and village water supplies damaged during the October 1989 earthquake, whose epicenter was located in Yanbei prefecture of Shanxi province. School and health-center equipment will also be purchased, and assistance provided for earthquake prediction and disaster preparedness. Total cost: $45.3 million."

1990,"Following a board review and endorsement of its role and activities, the committee undertook a comprehensive examination of the Bank's budget processes and procedures. This examination began in February 1989 and continued throughout fiscal 1990. In April 1989, the president of the Bank set up a budget-process task force to recommend a simpler, more transparent budget process and urged the task force to proceed in parallel with the deliberations of the committee on the general topic of institutional planning and budget processes. The report of the task force was forwarded to the committee in November 1989 with specific references to how certain issues cited by the committee had been addressed, namely flexibility and trade-offs; full-cost nominal budgeting: monitoring and evaluation; incentives for savings; and transparency, simplicity, and cost-effectiveness. The committee is in the process of preparing a response to the recommendations contained in the task-force report, including suggestions on the appropriate role of the board in the Bank's budget processes."
1990,"The pace of development slowed markedly in 1989 in almost all regions of the world. Growth in the economies of the seven major industrial countries (the G-7) moderated to 3.5 percent, from 4.6 percent in 1988.1 Still buoyant, this growth in 1989 was accompanied by a fall in unemployment rates and some pickup in inflation. Fears of inflation in the industrial countries resulted in more conservative monetary policies, and world interest rates rose, leading to some concern about the possibility of a significant slowdown. Yet, on balance, the prospects for the industrial countries remain favorable as investment and trade continue to expand. The volume of world trade grew by a robust 7 percent in 1989 (as opposed to about 9 percent in 1988), with above-average export growth achieved by the United States and member countries of the European Community (EC)."
1990,"The fundamental change that took place in Eastern and Central Europe during the year thrust that region into the spotlight. Major issues for these economies, whose entire structures are being reoriented, include price reform, property rights, the sequencing and pace of enterprise reform, the design of social ""safety nets"" to protect the more vulnerable segments of the population, the extent of openness of the economy, and the scale and composition of needed external assistance. At present, their economies are small, with a share in world trade of only 3.7 percent. The restructuring and integration of these economies into the world trading system, however, should provide considerable opportunities for growth and investment. A new source of support for this process is expected to be the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which will provide financing for investment projects (most of which will be in the private sector) in Eastern and Central Europe."
1990,"The growth of trade and GNP extended the global business expansion into its seventh year. This added to existing demands on resources, especially on capacity utilization and skilled labor, which resulted in a general increase in production costs. As a result, the rate of increase in consumer prices in the G-7 countries rose to 4.3 percent from 3.1 percent in 1988. Inflation of the national product price"
1990,"and medium run. These countries, excluding the Soviet Union, constitute a small share of the global economy, with a total GDP that is roughly equivalent to about 6 percent of world GDP. Their share in world trade is approximately 3.7 percent, over half of which is within the framework of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA). This is likely to change in the years to come, as these economies develop greater access to world markets."
1990,"The economic-reform packages being adopted include various combinations of price decontrol, trade liberalization, fiscal reform, and institutional changes such as those relating to property rights. The proper sequence and the pacing of reform strategies are critical, given the need for both stabilization and fundamental adjustments in several of these economies. Poland's extensive program is motivated by the view that no structural reforms can be effective in an unstable macroeconomic environment, and the reform process, therefore, began with a major stabilization program,"
1990,"which also includes a major structural component of trade reform. Rapid reform has been facilitated by the popular support that the government enjoys. In contrast, the reform process in Hungary has been a more gradual one that has evolved over a number of years. Obviously, the central challenge for the governments of Eastern and Central Europe will be to find a way to restructure their economies to achieve sustained economic growth while minimizing the transitional social costs of unemployment, inflation, and uncertainty."
1990,"A central concern of the developing economies has been the degree to which their needs for external financing, investment, and trade will be ""crowded out"" by Eastern and Central European demand. While the World Bank has emphasized that its assistance to Eastern and Central Europe will not be provided at the expense of other developing countries, it is likely that some private capital flows will be diverted to Eastern and Central Europe. Given the commercial banks' experience with sovereign lending in the recent past, it seems likely that the bulk of private flows to Eastern and Central Europe will be in the form of project and trade financing."
1990,"over 19 percent to $16 per barrel. As a result, the group, as a whole, recorded a balanced position on its aggregate current account for the first time since 1982. The growth rate in real GDP in the high-income oil exporters rose to 6.6 percent, while real incomes, which include adjustments for gains in terms of trade, rose by over 8 percent. This contrasts with 1988, when real GDP grew by only 2.7 percent, reflecting continuing instability in oil earnings."
1990,Trends in World Trade
1990,"The value of world merchandise trade again grew faster than output and rose to a record $3.1 trillion ($3,100 billion) in 1989. This total represents a 7.5 percent value increase over"
1990,"1988 and is associated with a 7 percent growth in volume. Growth rates in the latter half of the decade were generally higher than those in the first half and averaged 3.5 percent a year. As in recent years, manufactures was a key growth sector, accounting for about 80 percent of the total 1988-89 increase in the value of trade. Developed countries generally experienced the highest growth rates, while exports of the socialist countries of Europe were static or declining. Within the former group, above-average real export growth was achieved by the United States and the EC, while Japan's export growth was below the world average."
1990,"than the world average, as shipments from the leading exporters of manufactures in Asia fell sharply. As a consequence, export growth was moderate and balanced in every region. The expansion in Latin America's exports, which exceeded world export growth in 1988, fell to about 3.5 percent, half the world average. The growth in OPEC exports, approximately 9 percent, constituted the most dynamic element in developing countries' trade and accounted for just under one quarter of these countries"" merchandise exports. This implied that developing countries' nonoil export volumes grew more slowly than the total for 1989."
1990,"national trade. Under Section 301 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, the U.S. trade representative (USTR) can cite countries for unfair trade practices and initiate procedures to negotiate for their removal or to secure compensation. In the event of unsatisfactory results, the USTR is empowered to conduct an investigation into alleged unfair-trade practices that may result in retaliatory action against these countries' imports. Three countries were so cited in 1989; early in 1990, however, as a result of progress in negotiations and changes in economic policy, two of the three were dropped from the list."
1990,"January 1, 1990. Finally, trade was liberalized on a bilateral basis, with tariffs and some nontariff measures reduced under the terms of the U.S.-Canadian Free Trade Agreement."
1990,"Developments in Eastern and Central Europe during 1989 have wide-ranging implications for future trade relations. Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland, in particular, began either to implement or to prepare broad, free-market economic reforms that promise to alter the direction and composition of these nations' trade."
1990,"Negotiations in the Uruguay Round, scheduled for completion in December 1990, continued during 1989. Progress was made in some areas, such as the agreement in the mid-term negotiations to establish a mechanism to review the trade policies of individual countries, including Australia, Morocco, and the United States. In other areas, important differences were not resolved. Agriculture was one such area, with the debate revolving on how fast to liberalize trade and eliminate domestic support programs. In spite of intense negotiations, countries remain undecided on the best way to measure agricultural protection and on the mechanics of the liberalization process."
1990,"In the negotiations on textiles and clothing, pressure increased during 1989 for the removal of the Multifibre Arrangement, which systematically discriminates against the exports of developing countries. Major unresolved problems clearly remain, since many of the proposals on liberalization are linked to difficult discussions on the selective application of safeguards to counter surges of imports. Intellectual property is another area where divisions persisted in 1989. Developed countries, for example, want reinforced patent protection and new initiatives to combat trademark violations, while developing countries want freer access to new technology and less costly pharmaceuticals."
1990,"During 1989, developing countries, individually and in coalitions with other developed and developing countries, for the first time emerged as active players in global trade negotiations, making proposals in many areas of the negotiations. How their concerns are accommodated in the final negotiating process will have a major influence on the evolving nature of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).7"
1990,"7 At its May 1990 meeting in Washington. D.C., the Development Committee called on both developed and developing countries to reach an early agreement on these issues and to agree on a strengthened multilateral trading system based on predictable and uniform rules to promote trade liberalization by all countries. The committee stressed that a successful conclusion of the negotiations was essential to prevent the drift toward protectionism. Members also emphasized that improved access to markets and greater participation by developing countries in GATT benefits were essential and in many cases more important than official development assistance flows or debt relief in facilitating the adjustment and growth efforts of developing countries."
1990,"The report also calls for increased regional cooperation and integration—to be pursued through a series of pragmatic, incremental steps to facilitate trade across borders—and faster removal of the many obstacles to the movement of capital, labor, and goods and services within the framework of global trade liberalization."
1990,"Efforts to reduce commercial debt and debt-service burdens will be brought under the SPA umbrella during the 1991-93 phase, as well. It is hoped that, as a result, debt workouts can be made more comprehensive and effective and that, through a resumption of normal relations with commercial creditors, spreads of trade credits can be lowered and impediments to foreign investment reduced. The extinguishing of commercial debt through cash buybacks in the initial twenty-two SPA countries could require between $200 million and $300 million, depending on discounts. Financing for this component would include a portion of the $100 million facility administered by IDA for commercial debt and debt-service reduction, plus associated cofinancing."
1990,Other significant events in the Eastern and Central European region during the year included initiatives to develop alternatives to the existing trade regime of countries that belong to the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA). The direction of reform under consideration would place trade on a convertible-currency basis and reflect world prices.
1990,"While the reform agenda in these countries will broadly follow this pattern, countries differ significantly in their economic structure and level of development and in the extent of their external indebtedness and dependence on CMEA trade. Important differences are also imbedded in the education and training systems that determine a country's adaptability to the requirements of a market economy."
1990,"The government's stabilization program, launched in March 1990, was supported by an IMF standby arrangement and by a second structural-adjustment loan from the Bank. The reform measures supported by the loan seek to liberalize further the price and trade regime and ensure the continued operation of a competitive foreign-exchange system. More significant, the loan supports the government's bold initiative to restructure the financial and social-enterprise systems and to strengthen their overall discipline in the economy, while also supporting improvements in the country's social safety-net system. A financial-sector adjustment loan, now in an advanced stage of preparation, seeks to assist further the significant deepening of the country's supply-response measures, with a focus on the implementation of financial-sector"
1990,"Moreover, few mechanisms exist for easing the burden of this commercial debt, in contrast with Paris Club arrangements for bilateral official debt. In general, the reschedulings obtained by low-income countries from commercial banks have been less favorable than those obtained by middle-income debtors. This is caused partly by the weaker bargaining position of these countries and partly by their greater dependence on commercial banks for trade credits and other financial services. Despite efforts by these countries to service their commercial debt, or to reach agreement with their commercial creditors, not all countries have been able to make contractual payments regularly, and arrears have accumulated."
1990,"The directors also expressed general agreement with the conclusion that in countries that need structural reforms with a long gestation period (tax reform, public-sector restructuring and privatization, and financial-sector reform, for instance), the Bank should try to match the timing of its disbursements to the speed at which the reforms can be introduced. Adjustment loans should have multiple tranches when the program requires extensive institutional development or when a step-by-step introduction of reforms, such as trade liberalization, would reduce adjustment costs. In these cases, the assurance of a continued flow of financial support would enhance the credibility of the program. The appropriate choice from the menu of currently available options— one large multitranche loan; a sequence of smaller, two-tranche loans; or policy-based sector-investment loans—should depend on the particular circumstances of the country."
1990,"Some seventeen public-sector expenditure reviews were carried out between January 1989 and the end of June 1990. All analyzed the prospects for divestiture and for increased private competition with public enterprises. Since, with some exceptions, the reviews were not able to specifically identify private alternatives to public programs or document possible adverse effects from the displacing or ""crowding out"" of private expenditures, work is under way to develop a methodology to assist Bank staff and governments in analyzing trade-offs and weighing the effects of crowding out and displacement against the complementary effects of public investment on the private sector."
1990,"market in the United States. The objective of global bonds was to reduce the IBRD's U.S. dollar borrowing costs by developing an instrument and a system of distribution and trading of U.S. dollar-denominated bonds that would prove more attractive to investors and intermediaries than competing products. Global bonds were designed to respond to preferences of institutional investors and to permit the full range of international and domestic demand to be reflected in a world price for the securities by eliminating impediments to liquid, transre-gional trading. They are simultaneously offered in the world's major financial centers and trade fluidly among those centers thereafter."
1990,"The environment. Research on environmental issues is now becoming integrated into the activities of all PRE departments. Two major research papers were produced during fiscal 1990, one on agricultural policies in industrial countries and their environmental impacts, and the other on conservation of the world's biological diversity. Other research initiatives under way or planned encompass a wide range of topics: forestry conservation; irrigation and drainage; sanitation and water supply; energy conservation and efficiency; air-quality management; environmental institutions; treatment of environment in cost-benefit analysis; environment and national-income accounting; fiscal policy and environmental management; trade policy and resource degradation; privatization of common resources; and international industrial location and environment. Within this broad range of topics, three themes are emerging as the priority areas for research in the coming years: (a) global climate change,"
1990,"Reform in socialist economies. Research on reform in socialist economies is being carried out in several departments of PRE, as well as in the Europe, Middle East, and North Africa region of the Bank. A socialist-economies reform unit was established in PRE during the year to provide an anchor and coordinating mechanism for policy and research work on the problems that are encountered in moving from centrally planned economies towards market-based economies. Work planned or under way is grouped under five headings: macro-economic management and transitional policies; comparative studies of policies, sequencing, and performance; response of firms to economic reform; labor-market and social issues; and trade and financial-sector reform. A number of re-"
1990,"Debt, financial intermediation, and adjustment. In the past two years, a great deal of work has been concentrated on issues of structural adjustment and stabilization (studies have been undertaken on strategies to stop high inflation, for example) and on ways to deal with the consequences of temporary trade shocks. A new set of tools for analyzing macro issues has been developed and will be implemented in fiscal 1991. These analytical tools are extensions of the basic macro models used"
1990,"in the Bank. Research is now beginning to shift away from the analysis of stabilization to that of longer-term growth, as evidenced by a series of studies on the determinants of savings, investment, and growth. Greater emphasis is also being given to research that seeks to improve understanding of the links among macroeconomic policy, growth, and sustainable development. With the completion of a trade-policy paper, work will move away from a macro view to a focus on the effect of trade-policy reform in particular sectors, notably agriculture. In the area of domestic financial intermediation, much of the work has dealt with the management, supervision, and regulation of banks and the banking sector. Emphasis is now given to dissemination of the results through operational support in this area. Research to date on debt issues has resulted in a number of papers and a book, Dealing with the Debt Crisis.* The analysis of these issues and that of international capital flows will continue, but more attention is being paid to the prospects for external finance other than debt, such as foreign direct investment. Finally, the support and analysis that the Bank has given to developing countries in the Uruguay Round of the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) negotiations will be replaced by the analysis of the effect of the agreements reached and of the determinants of international trade growth."
1990,"Participation in other OECD fora allows the Bank to add its development perspective to the discussion of issues of concern to the industrial countries, such as trade, inflation, and savings and investment. From the meetings that it attends on banking, debt, economic forecasting, trade, and agriculture, the Bank is able to gain a perspective that enhances its advisory and analytical work with developing countries. The ministerial-level annual OECD meeting at the end of May and meetings of the OECD's Economic Policy Committee (which focus on"
1990,"such concerns as inflation, public expenditure, subsidies, competition, and the integration of environmental and economic policies) are important fora for the Bank. The 1990 ministerial meeting highlighted the issues of the Uruguay Round, agricultural trade and support policies, noninflationary growth, OECD relations with nonmember countries, and the global environment."
1990,"The Bank continues to expand its dialogue with NGOs on important development-policy issues of common concern. Many NGOs, in both developed and developing countries, want to contribute to the Bank's thinking on a variety of issues, particularly those related to the social and environmental aspects of development. The NGO-Bank Committee provides a formal, international forum for such discussion. The majority of the twenty-six NGO leaders who serve on the committee come from developing countries. The main topics discussed at the committee's ninth annual meeting (held in Bangkok on October 31 and November 1, 1989) were grassroots participation in development planning and NGO views on Bank policies in the areas of structural adjustment, international debt, and trade."
1990,"The flow of PCRs increasingly reflects the full scope and diversity of Bank lending. Those on adjustment operations now cover not only structural-adjustment loans but a growing number of trade-adjustment, export, and sector-adjustment loans, as well. In fiscal 1990, the number of PCRs that were released in previously underrepresented sectors—such as oil and gas, urban operations, and forestry— also increased."
1990,"Eastern and central Africa. Several countries in East Africa turned in a favorable economic performance in 1989. In Uganda, the continued dismantling of trade and other controls improved the availability of basic commodities and imported inputs on the domestic market. A cumulative nominal devaluation of the shilling by 59 percent during 1989 also contributed to the adjustment of the economy. Impressive gains were made in the productive sectors; agricultural and industrial production grew by an estimated 5 percent and 12 percent, respectively. Overall, GDP increased by about 5 percent, implying growth in per capita GDP of about 2 percent. Considerable progess has also been made in the rehabilitation of the country's social and economic infrastructure. However, inflation remains high, and the collapse in world coffee prices has greatly complicated the task of financial stabilization. Kenya continued its favorable economic performance into 1989. Although GDP growth"
1990,"The rate of growth in Mauritius declined from an average of about 8 percent in the previous five years to an estimated 4.6 percent in 1989, with the export-processing zones growing by only 6 percent, as compared with well over 20 percent in previous years. Inflationary pressures are also rising, as the economy is beginning to overheat. The economy of Madagascar is picking up, as it starts to respond to an increasingly vigorous liberalization program. In 1989. the economy entered its second year of positive per capita growth after almost a generation of decline. In 1989, GDP rose by about 4 percent, reflecting a 3.9 percent increase in agricultural production, good performance in livestock and fisheries, and strong growth in trade and tourism. Rice production increased by 7.6 percent. After eight consecutive years of decline, the volume of imports increased (by about 5 percent in 1989), and export volumes rose sharply (by 29 percent)."
1990,"Tanzania and Mozambique continued to implement their adjustment programs. In Tanzania, GDP increased by an estimated 4.4 percent in 1989, as the performance of the agricultural sector (and others, as well) continued to strengthen, reflecting an improving policy environment. However, infrastructural bottlenecks and public-sector management problems led to worsening financial performance and continuing high inflation. In Mozambique, GDP growth slowed to 3.2 percent in 1989. Progress was made in foreign trade and exchange management and the rationalization of public expenditures. The recovery of income"

The WID initiative, launched by the Bank in 1987, is beginning to have an effect in sub-Saharan Africa; more than a third of the operations approved in the past two years had specific components or were oriented to address this issue, while more than a third of the Bank's analytical economic and sector work has contained significant discussion of gender issues. In agriculture, provision of extension services that meet the needs of women is critical. In Tanzania, a Bank-supported project includes support for research on women's cashew production; it will provide extension services and recruit female extension staff, use marketing advisers to train women traders, and identify constraints on women's access to trade credit. In eight states of Nigeria, Bank-supported projects are completing a reorganization of the extension system to take account of the fact that 40 percent of contact farmers are female. In Ghana, recent analysis has established that by the year 2000, female farmers will dominate farming, a fact that will have profound implications for the extension service. In The Gambia, the region's first freestanding WID project was approved during the year; it supports a wide range of activities designed to provide opportunities for women to improve their economic status through expanded access to productive resources and basic social services."
1990,"Through a similar orientation of economic policy, the Philippines has emerged from a period of stabilization and adjustment with three years of strong growth, a new and important agreement with its commercial creditors, and an orderly approach to its debt problem. At the heart of the recent Philippine strategy have been steps toward structural reforms in trade, the financial sector, public institutions, and taxes. These reforms have begun to curtail the public sector's claims on resources while, at the same time, raising private investment. Notably, the government has actively pursued reform of the large corporate sector, including steps toward privatization and dissolution or restructuring of publicly owned enterprises and assets. Difficult issues still lie ahead for the Philippines. Foremost, macroeconomic stability must be maintained. The priorities are to reverse the recent deterioration of the current"

Thus, after losses of $1.4 billion and an estimated $0.8 billion during the past two fiscal years, respectively, India's gross reserves stood at two months' equivalent of imports in early 1990. Elsewhere, other factors were at work: Security concerns distracted policy agendas and frustrated the revival of private investment in Sri Lanka, and Nepal's trade and supply systems came under great pressure."
1990,"In March 1989, the trade-and-transit treaties between Nepal and India expired following a breakdown in renewal negotiations. Nepal's imports of petroleum were restricted temporarily, creating serious shortages in the economy, and its exports to India fell dramatically. Consequently, Nepal's GDP grew by only 1.5 percent in fiscal year 1989,' well below the 4.5 percent target. The government implemented a tight fiscal policy to cope with the impact of the trade-and-transit impasse, which ended in June 1990 when the two countries agreed to restore full arrangements by July."

Long-standing and centrally directed systems of economic management are being reversed, and the economies of these countries are being reoriented towards the productive sectors, with increased attention being paid to rural, export, and private initiatives. Viet Nam has telescoped into a relatively short period wide-ranging structural reforms in its public finances, in agriculture, in industry, and in trade.

Lending operations during the year included a gas-utilization project and a telecommunications project, both of which were designed to improve management and operational efficiency in two important state enterprises. A cement-industry restructuring loan to India will expand capacity and support continuing policy reform in the sector. For Bangladesh, a financial-sector credit will strengthen credit discipline, improve debt recovery of nationalized commercial banks, and reform policies on interest rates, monetary instruments, and treatment of subsidies."

1990,"In response to the slow growth in output, increasing unemployment, the strain on its budget, and a deteriorating balance of payments, the government initiated a series of reforms in 1988 and accelerated the process in 1989. The reform process culminated in the adoption of a comprehensive medium-term adjustment program supported by an IMF standby arrangement. This was followed by agreements with the Paris and London Clubs on the rescheduling of debt and with the Bank on a $150 million industry and trade-adjustment loan. Main elements of the reform program that have been implemented to date include measures to reduce the budget deficit, a freeze on new external borrowing, devaluation of the Jordanian dinar, deregulation of the financial sector, and measures to stimulate industry and trade. The government's program also includes the creation of a social-development fund to alleviate the impact of adjustment measures on the economically disadvantaged."

To complement these measures, the government has resolved to initiate and accelerate structural reforms, such as privatization of state enterprises, liquidation of loss-making activities, and price and trade liberalization. The government also has proposed implementing fundamental reforms of its social policy and distribution framework to protect the poor and those most adversely affected by the economic restructuring. In the first half of 1990, in the wake of a significant improvement in the current account, a new government was formed. The government has announced its determination to take whatever steps are necessary to keep the country solvent."
1990,"The IMF supported Poland's stabilization efforts through a standby arrangement in February 1990, agreement was reached with Paris Club creditors for the rescheduling of maturities during 1990 and the first quarter of 1991, and the Bank initiated its lending program by committing a total of S781 million for projects in the areas of agroprocessing, export industries, transport, energy, and pollution reduction. In addition, the Bank established an office in Warsaw to serve as a channel for dialogue on the country's development strategy. While foreign-trade performance in Poland is likely to improve over the medium term, the country's external-debt problem will continue to circumscribe severely any opportunities for a return to creditworthiness. Both official creditors and commercial banks are currently discussing new approaches to the debt problem with the government."
1990,"The new reform program, which has the support of the IMF and the Bank, has already dramatically reduced the rate of inflation and is expected to stimulate supply. At the heart of the new policy package and addressing the root causes of persistent economic instability is a systematic program for restructuring financial-sector and nonfinancial-sector enterprises; such restructuring is to be complemented by fiscal financing of enterprise deficits. The economic program supported by the Bank (through a second structural-adjustment loan) and the IMF (through a standby arrangement) includes measures in the areas of incomes policy, monetary and fiscal policies, trade and foreign-exchange policies, bank and enterprise restructuring, and the social safety net."
1990,"The increased earnings from exports of goods and services—they reached a record nominal value of $110 billion in 1989— facilitated the recovery of imports, even though the volume of imported goods and services is still below the 1979-81 level of $110 billion. The region's trade surplus has also continued to grow, but its path has reflected the deceleration in the growth of export earnings. In 1989, the increased trade surplus of the region was complemented by flows of investments into a few countries, particularly Mex-"

Nonproject and adjustment operations in Mexico, the largest recipient of this type of lending, supported debt-reduction efforts, policy reforms in trade and export institutions, road transport, and telecommunications. Lending to Venezuela, the second largest recipient of nonproject and adjustment lending, is supporting the continuing financial-sector liberalization, begun in fiscal 1989 and supported by a structural-adjustment loan, as well as reforms in public enterprises and privatization."

A forestry-development project in Durango and Chihuahua states seeks to improve environmental protection, stimulate increased production and efficiency in the forestry sector, ameliorate the balance-of-trade deficit in forest products, and increase employment and wages for the rural poor, especially in the traditionally impoverished Amerindian communities. Total cost: $91.1 million."

The government's ongoing structural-adjustment program will be supported through an industry and trade-policy adjustment loan that encourages implementation of policy reforms designed to create a more uniform, nondistortionary set of incentives across different economic sectors."
1990,SAO TOME AND PRINCIPE: IDA—$9.8 million. Phase two of the government's structural-adjustment program for the period 1990-92—its broad thrust continues to be on improved incentives for increasing the production of traded goods within a stable macroeconomic environment—will be supported. Cofinancing is expected from the ADF ($12 million) and the IMF ($2.6 million).
1990,"UGANDA: IDA—$125 million. The third phase of the government's economic-recovery program, involving measures to reinforce demand management, further liberalize trade, revitalize the private sector, and bring about a fundamental rationalization of public-sector management, will be supported."
1990,HAITI: IDA—$11.4 million. Technical and financial assistance will be provided to private industrial enterprises that need to restructure to adjust to new trade-reform policies and to enterprises (mostly small and medium-sized) that need financial assistance only. Total cost: $24.6 million.
1990,"Official cofinancing from Japan, through the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund and the Export-Import Bank of Japan, continues to account for the largest share of official cofinancing in support of Bank-assisted operations. Both agencies have been increasing their lending activities on a global basis under Japan's expanded capital-recycling program. Cofinancing from the two agencies is expected to total $2 billion equivalent for nineteen projects approved in fiscal 1990. Over the past four fiscal years, the untied-loan facility of the Export-Import Bank of Japan has been particularly important for the Bank's cofinancing program. To date, twenty-six loan agreements have been concluded between the Export-Import Bank of Japan and World Bank borrowers for a total of $6.1 billion equivalent in cofinancing, of which thirteen agreements, for a total of $2.3 billion equivalent, were concluded in fiscal 1990."
1990,"Through the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund, Japan remained the largest source of bilateral official cofinancing for the region. The Export-Import Bank of Japan was the largest source of export-credit financing. The introduction of sector lending into the lending program of the IDB was also an important factor in the substantial increase in the availability of resources for cofinancing. In fiscal 1990, seven Bank projects drew cofinancing from the IDB in the amount of $1.3 billion."

1947,"Amounts in currencies other than United States dollars have been translated into United States dollars at the rates recognized in making capital payments by member countries. In the cases of 37 members these rates are the established par values under the International Monetary Fund Agreement. In the cases of nine members (Brazil,* China, Finland, France, Greece, Italy, Poland, Uruguay and Yugoslavia), the par values of their currencies had not been so established at June 30, 1948."
1947,"The fact must be frankly faced, however, that full realization of the Bank's potentialities cannot be expected as long as economic and financial stability in large areas of the world continues to be threatened by political tensions and unrest. The prevailing political uncertainties undermine confidence, hamper productive investment and disrupt normal trade relations. So long as this condition continues, the Bank will be faced with difficulties not only in making good loans but also in convincing the private investment market, to which it must look for the major portion of its loanable resources, that its investment portfolio is sound. Only as the world political situation becomes more stable can the Bank proceed with full momentum toward the accomplishment of its declared purposes."
1947,"It was not until the winter of 1946-47 that the Bank was organized to the point that it could seriously consider making its first loans for European reconstruction. By that time it had become clear that the physical devastation, disruption of trade and industrial and governmental dislocations caused by the war were far greater than had been envisaged at Bretton Woods. The economic problems with which the European nations were confronted at the end of the UNRRA period involved much more than the reconstruction or modernization of specific productive facilities; there was also urgent need for assistance to prevent interruption of the flow of imports, primarily of food, fuel and raw materials. By the end of 1946, European resources of dollar exchange had fallen to dangerously low levels and credits from the United States and other Western Hemisphere countries had largely been exhausted."
1947,"The many reasons for this have frequently been stated. One major factor is the increase in Western Europe's population by approximately 8% since before the war. Another is the change in the terms of trade to the detriment of the Western European countries as a whole, and particularly of the United Kingdom, prices of the food and raw materials which constitute the bulk of their imports having risen considerably more than the prices of the industrial goods which they export. Again, the necessary liquidation of foreign investments and the destruction of merchant vessels as a result of the war have substantially reduced Europe's invisible income. At the same time, military expenditures, vastly increased over pre-war requirements, are absorbing as much as 20% or 25 % of the entire national budget of some of the ERP countries, causing in certain cases a severe drain on their foreign exchange resources. Finally, the physical devastation has been so great that, despite the capital investment already made, a portion of Europe's productive output must still be diverted to repair of war damage, particularly housing."
1947,"It will not suffice, therefore, to restore European production and trade as they existed before the war; indeed, the magnitude of Europe's problems makes thinking in pre-war"
1947,"terms unrealistic. New and bold concepts are required if some of Europe's fundamental weaknesses are to be corrected and new sources of strength provided. The volume of production must be greatly increased and the costs of production substantially reduced. There must be a new pattern of production which will permit both a reduction of imports and an increase of exports. And there must be a reorientation of Europe's trade channels to conform to the fundamental changes which have taken place in world conditions. In short, if Europe is again to become self-supporting at a tolerable standard of living, the need is for a fundamental readjustment in the structure of its economy, The basic objective of the European Recovery Program is to enable Europe, by its own efforts, to achieve just such a readjustment."
1947,"It is necessary in any discussion of the European Recovery Program to distinguish between the problems connected with the allocation and use of ERP funds, on the one hand, and the problems connected with the readjustment of Europe's trade and production, on the other."
1947,and to effect the necessary changes in the pattern of their trade.
1947,"It would clearly not be appropriate for the Bank to attempt any analysis of how the ERP countries can best improve the utilization of their existing piant and equipment. Yet no objective appraisal of the requirements for European recovery can fail to note the substantial opportunities which exist to increase industrial output through better management techniques, the standardization, concentration and specialization of production, the removal of unnecessarily restrictive trade union practices and, in some cases, longer hours of work. The potentialities are not susceptible of accurate statistical estimate, but they are undoubtedly great."
1947,"(3) FREEING INTRA-EUROPEAN TRADE. Increase of production will not be enough unless there are accessible markets in which to dispose of the expanded output, and unless efficiency is improved to an extent which will enable the producers to compete in those markets. Modern industrial techniques and equipment depend to a large degree upon"
1947,"During the period between the wars there was an increasing development of trade, currency and other restrictions which hampered the free flow of goods and narrowed the markets for European products. In the post-war period such restrictions have increased. The free markets now available to most of the separate European countries are not sufficiently broad to permit full development of modernized production at economical cost."
1947,"Unless the markets for European products can be broadened and greater freedom of intra-European trade can be attained, the hope for ultimate European recovery will be dimmed and the opportunity afforded by ERP will be lost. Trade barriers in whatever form tend to breed productive inefficiency. They enable inefficient and uneconomic enterprises to survive and prevent efficient producers from reaching the markets they need to improve their efficiency and increase their production."
1947,"In existing conditions certain trade restrictions may be necessary in order to conserve the dwindling foreign exchange resources of the Western European countries and the removal of those restrictions may not be immediately practicable. In the meantime, however, it is vital that the Western European countries see to it that their investments in the improvement and expansion of their productive resources are so directed that they do not aggravate the situation and constitute new sources of pressure for continued and increased trade restrictions in the future. That will require a degree of economic cooperation among Western European countries which they have never achieved in the past."
1947,"Whether or not the existing obstacles to freedom of intra-European trade can be removed without some kind of European union is a question on which opinions differ. The difficulties of achieving such a union are frequently underestimated by those who overlook the historical and deep-rooted differences in language, customs, traditions and national habits and prejudices among the European countries. At best the attainment of such a union may be a slow process."
1947,"Cooperative effort to that end in one form or another, but in some effective form, would seem to be a sine qua non to progress. The OEEC may well be the best available vehicle for furthering that effort. It may be hoped that this organization will be permitted to do more than just recommend how United States financial assistance shall be allocated. If, in addition, it is increasingly entrusted with responsibility for guiding the necessary readjustment of the ERP countries' production and trade, it should become a powerful force for the economic unification of Western Europe. The more strength and influence that the OEEC possesses, and the more it comes to be a truly international body and not merely a grouping of conflicting national claimants, the more it will contribute to fulfilling the great hopes which ERP has inspired."
1947,"(4) GERMANY. The problem of Germany deserves special mention. Production in Bizon-ia, although it has shown a steady rise during the past year, is still only about 5 0 % of pre-war. This is not attributable in major degree to the lack of productive facilities. The principal factors have rather been chaotic monetary conditions, the lack of working capital, the absence of effective political mechanisms, the almost complete disruption of trade connections, the inevitably dampening effects of military occupation upon all sectors of the economy and the over-all political uncertainty."
1947,"The condition of Germany has direct and immediate repercussions upon the economic situation of the rest of Europe. Before the war, Germany accounted for approximately 11% of the international trade of the ERP countries;"
1947,"in 1947 the comparable figure was about 2%. Clearly, therefore, more effective utilization of German productive facilities, to the extent consistent with security precautions, is an essential requirement for European recovery. Some improvement may be hoped for as a result of the recent currency reform, the steps being taken to improve governmental machinery and the considerable increase in imports which ERP aid will make possible. A further liberalization of the conditions now governing Germany's international trade would also be of substantial help. The pace of recovery in Germany, however, may depend to a great extent upon the settlement of German political issues by the occupying powers."
1947,"(5) PATTERN OF PRODUCTION AND TRADE. Before the war Western Europe normally depended on its trade with and investments in the Far East, particularly Southeast Asia, to provide it with the dollars to finance its import surplus from the Western Hemisphere. The importance of Southeast Asia as a source of dollar supply resulted from the fact that it was the only major region with which the United States had an import surplus before the war. This situation no longer obtains. Recovery in the Far East will be a long process and, even when it is achieved, it may be anticipated that the relation of the Far Eastern economy to Europe and the United States will have been substantially altered. The Far East may be able to provide Europe with increased raw material imports to replace some existing imports from the Western Hemisphere, but it cannot be relied upon to provide Europe with a substantial portion of the dollars necessary to meet its dollar import requirements. Since Europe cannot depend upon an export surplus with any of the other areas outside of the Western Hemisphere to provide it with dollars and since only a moderate increase can be expected in Europe's invisible dollar earnings, the long run need is clearly for Europe both to increase its exports to the dollar area and to decrease its imports from that area."
1947,"States dropped from 7.1% to less than 5.7% of the total and, in volume, were considerably below the 1938 figure. This occurred despite the substantial tariff reductions made by the United States in recent years, the absence of import quotas, and a national income in the United States almost three times the 1938 level. While exports to the Western Hemisphere as a whole amounted to 15.7% of the total as compared with 13.5% before the war, this increase is far from sufficient to compensate for the increased demand for dollar imports and for the loss of dollar earnings from trade with the Far East."
1947,"Equilibrium cannot, therefore, be achieved without a readjustment of production and trade so as to promote larger exports to the Western Hemisphere, even at the cost of some sacrifice of established markets in Europe or other areas. Further development in the dependent areas of the production of raw materials such as chrome, lead, copper and tin, in which the resources of the United States are deficient, would seem to afford particularly promising opportunities. There is also a large demand in the United States for consumer goods, especially those in the luxury or semi-luxury categories, and for other special manufactures of traditional high quality. Canada and Latin America offer substantial and ready markets for capital goods and industrial products of all kinds."
1947,"For European producers to reach the American market effectively, more is required, of course, than the adjustment of their production to the demands of that market. Steps will also have to be taken, possibly through collective action, to create promotional, distributing and sales mechanisms which can fit successfully into established American marketing procedures. Similarly, it is important that the trade policies of the United States be adapted to its position as the great creditor nation of the world."
1947,"Reference must also be made to the vital importance of East-West trade within Europe itself. In 1938, Eastern Europe accounted for around 8% of Western Europe's trade; qualitatively such trade was more important than its aggregate quantity indicates, since each area provided the other with a high percentage of certain key products. In 1947, however, Western Europe's imports from Eastern Europe amounted to only 4.4% of the total, while only 6% of Western Europe's exports went to Eastern Europe. An expansion of this trade from its present levels would make available to the Western European nations additional supplies, particularly of foodstuffs, coal and timber, which they need to replace present dollar imports, and would make available to the Eastern European nations increased amounts of the capital equipment and industrial raw materials they require for their reconstruction and development programs. The recent unanimous resolution of the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, requesting its Economic Commission for Europe to take steps to promote trade throughout the whole of Europe, is encouraging in this respect, since it indicates a general recognition of the importance of East-West trade and some agreement to move towards its improvement."
1947,"Accordingly, it is the intention of the Bank to supplement ERP, to the extent that the Bank's resources (in the light of the other demands upon them) and the credit standing of the ERP countries permit, primarily by financing projects which involve permanent additions to productive capacity. The Bank will be particularly interested in those projects which will benefit more than one of the participating nations and which will generally promote international trade."
1947,"veloped countries requires an expansion of their production, primarily through technological development and increased capital investment. This has always been a primary objective of the underdeveloped countries but its importance is now more sharply focused than ever before because, as a result of modern means of communication, their peoples are becoming increasingly aware of the contrast between their status and that of the peoples of the more economically advanced nations. The more advanced countries, too, have a vital interest in promoting the development of the underdeveloped areas, for the more effective utilization of the vast resources of those areas will result directly in an increase in trade between them and the more developed countries, to the substantial benefit of both."
1947,"The importance of working out an overall development program, to minimize spotty and wasteful investment, has already been emphasized. It appears axiomatic that such a program should be related to and based on the existing natural resources, the country's location, climate, and type of population and the financial and administrative resources available. It should attempt to balance the increase of economic production to meet essential domestic needs with the development of exports to accessible markets. It should favor the application of the limited supplies of capital to projects which will result in the greatest increase in production and trade in relation to the size of the investment. If these practical ends are kept in view it should not be too difficult to outline a balanced program setting forth a general pattern of development, on the basis of which public policies and projects can be intelligently formulated and appropriate private enterprise stimulated."
1947,"in relation to the total development needs of its member countries, it must emphasize those strategic projects which will eliminate production bottlenecks or generate increased output of related goods or in related areas. Second, as an international agency, the Bank is particularly interested in projects which are likely to contribute to a better balance in world trade. Third, the Bank's Articles of Agreement provide that ""the most useful and urgent projects, large and small alike"" must be dealt with first; the Bank must satisfy this requirement either by financing such projects itself or by helping to promote conditions necessary for their financing from other sources. And finally, the Bank's loans must be confined to projects for which financing through private or other channels is not available on reasonable terms."
1947,"inter-governmental and International Bank loans. In the long run, however, development on the scale that is within the range of practicability needs financial assistance in amounts which only the free flow of private capital can provide. Furthermore, it is desirable that a considerable part of the foreign capital employed for development purposes be in the form of equity investments in order to avoid an undue burden of fixed charges which might impair the credit of the borrowing country or intensify its balance of payments problems during a period of declining trade or falling prices. One of the principal objectives of the Bank, therefore, is to help to create conditions which will encourage a steady and substantial stream of private investment, particularly equity investment, flowing into its underdeveloped member countries."
1947,"The fact that the Bank has not been able to obtain consent to the use of larger amounts of non-dollar capital, or to the sale of nondollar bonds in markets outside the United States, is due primarily to difficulties which are inherent in the present economic situation of the world. Most of the traditional capital exporters in Western Europe have deficits in their current balances of payments; it is not to be expected that they can at the same time substantially expand their foreign investments. And even the relatively few countries which have maintained a favorable foreign exchange position are increasingly hesitant to undertake substantial foreign loan commitments for fear of aggravating domestic inflationary pressures or unduly depleting their foreign exchange reserves. But the Bank cannot function with full effectiveness as an international agency, and cannot fulfill its purpose of promoting a better balance in world trade, unless it can draw funds for its loans from expanded sources of capital. It is hoped, therefore, that those countries whose productivity and trade position permit the export of capital will increasingly make it possible for the Bank to use for loans the 18% of their capital subscription paid in in local currency, or to sell the Bank's non-dollar securities in their investment markets."
1947,"issued by the Bank is exempt from United States income taxes, including withholding taxes, if paid to an individual who is not a national or resident of the United States, or to a corporation organized under the laws of a country other than the United States, whether or not such corporation is engaged in trade or business in the United States, unless the corporation is a life insurance company and the interest is attributable, within the meaning of the United States Internal Revenue Code, to the company's life insurance business in the United States. These rulings should be of substantial assistance to the Bank in finding a market for its securities in countries other than the United States."
1947,"The Bank has also maintained close liaison with the United Nations and with other international organizations whose fields of activity are related to those of the Bank. The Bank has been represented at all of the meetings of the Economic and Social Council, the Economic and Employment Commission, the Subcommis-sion on Economic Development and the Sub-commission on Economic Stability and Employment. It has also been represented at meetings of the Economic Commission for Europe and its various committees and subcommittees and at meetings of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. Similarly, it participated in meetings of the committee established by the Economic and Social Council to consider the creation of an Economic Commission for Latin America. In addition, the Bank has participated in the Geneva and Havana conferences held for the purpose of drafting a charter for the proposed International Trade Organization. It has likewise been represented at various meetings of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and at the annual meeting of the Bank for International Settlements."
1947,"For eight months after those words were written, a vigorous and healthy debate on the European Recovery Program was conducted on both sides of the Atlantic. During part of this period the most urgent needs of a number of the European countries were met through large grants made by the United States under the Interim Aid Act. Finally, on April 3, 1948, the Economic Cooperation Act of 1948 was enacted into law, authorizing United States financial assistance for a recovery program for Europe to cover a period of slightly more than four years and the establishment of an Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) to administer such assistance. An initial sum of $5 billion was made available for this purpose. On April 16, representatives of the sixteen European participating countries and of Western Germany met in Paris and signed a convention establishing the Organization for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC) to implement the European undertakings which formed the basis of the program."
1947,"In existing conditions certain trade restrictions may be necessary in order to conserve the dwindling foreign exchange resources of the Western European countries and the removal of those restrictions may not be immediately practicable. In the meantime, however, it is vital that the Western European countries see to it that their investments in the improvement and expansion of their productive resources are so directed that they do not aggravate the situation and constitute new sources of pressure for continued and increased trade restrictions in the future. That will require a degree of economic cooperation among Western European countries which they have never achieved in the past."
1953,"Six British banks are participating in the loan, without the Bank's guarantee, to the extent of £645,000, representing the first seven maturities, falling due semi-annually from August 1, 1956 through August 1, 1959. The participating banks are The Chartered Bank of India, Australia & China; the Eastern Bank; Grindlays Bank; Lloyds Bank; the Mercantile Bank of India; and the National Bank of India."

1952,"The Bank's General Training Program (formerly called the Junior Professional and Administrative Program) is designed to give young men and women from the Bank's member countries experience with general problems of economic development and with the Bank's operations. The fifth year of this program began on January 1, 1953, with the enrollment of trainees from Ceylon, China, the Dominican Republic, Iraq, Nicaragua, Pakistan, the Philippines and Thailand. Citizens of 34 of the Bank's members have participated in this training and selections are now being made from candidates for the sixth annual course."
1952,"In any case, the programming body needs to be supported by a secretariat competent to bring it a balanced judgment on the separate plans of the ministries and departments. It is impossible to generalize on the size and composition of this staff. The secretariat of the Colombian Planning Council is small, and is able to rely to a considerable extent on research and staff services of the central bank. The secretariat of the Indian Planning Commission is rather extensive and is divided into the following sections: resource and economic surveys; finance; industry; trade and communication; food and agriculture; resource development; employment and social services. Several programming units regularly have the advice of advisory councils composed of private persons drawn from industrial, agricultural and trade groups."
1952,"The mission recommends that the Government make an inventory of British Guiana's extensive forest resources and formulate a program to assist the timber industry to improve and modernize its operations.   The aim of the program would be to increase the supplies of wood for domestic needs and to intensify production for export, especially in species of wood not now well known in world trade."
1952,"The difficult dollar position of Denmark noted in the Bank's Seventh Annual Report improved considerably during 1952. Her dollar trade deficit for the year was reduced by more than one-half. Imports from the dollar area declined; while, particularly as a result of larger expenditures by United States armed forces in Europe, export earnings increased."
1952,"Both the loans are expected to be disbursed and repayable entirely in European currencies. This is an important feature of the loan operations; the pattern of Yugoslavia's external trade is such that her exports go mainly to European markets and her opportunities of earning dollars are limited. The Government is buying equipment and supplies from the United States, Canada and eleven European countries. To finance these purchases the Bank is using, in addition to Swiss francs received from the sale of Bank bonds in Switzerland and sterling received from the sale of bonds in the United Kingdom, releases from the capital subscriptions of Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom."

1991,"Growth in the low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), of 2.3 percent in 1990, was considerably lower than the already low rates that have characterized recent years (see Table 2-3). The disappointing nature of economic performance in the LMICs in 1990 might be underscored by noting that it was the lowest growth rate since 1982; to find a period when developing countries grew at a pace slower than the industrialized countries, one has to go as far back as 1966 and 1967, years in which both China and India contracted. The fall in income was accompanied by a sharp reduction in consumption and investment in Eastern and Central Europe; a very low rate of investment in Latin America, especially Brazil; a fall in per capita consumption in sub-"

1991,"In 1990, Asian LMICs grew slightly faster than they did in 1989. China sought to cool down its economy by contracting the demand for investment, but slower-than-average growth in China was offset by the vigorous gains achieved in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. This pattern is likely to continue in the short run. India's economy grew at a steady rate in 1990, and, while it is likely to continue to do so in the short run (provided weather conditions remain favorable), the sharp curtailment of imports brought about by a shortage of foreign exchange will have a negative influence. India's financial difficulties go beyond the temporary effects of the Gulf crisis, encompassing as they do heightened indebtedness, slim reserves, and a growing public deficit. Furthermore, the fluidity of the current political situation makes it difficult to introduce needed fiscal reform. A number of countries in the region, including Bangladesh, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka, had weak economic growth in 1990. These coun-"
1991,"Increases in the value of exports were dominated by above-average growth in Western Europe (up 19.5 percent), in the OPEC countries (up 25.5 percent), and China (up 18 percent). The expansion of trade by value in Western Europe, which accounts for 47 percent of world exports, was mainly caused by a weaker dollar, while increases in the value of OPEC exports, accounting for 5 percent of world exports, resulted from the rise in crude-oil prices. In the developing regions, export growth was above average in Africa and Asia, but below the world average in Latin America (mainly the result of a contraction in Brazil's exports). Trends in commodity prices were the driving force behind many developing countries' growth of exports."
1991,"Other projects approved during the year that aim at enhancing vocational or scientific skills included those for Algeria, China, India, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, Togo, and Trinidad and Tobago."
1991,"A $155.6 million loan to India was approved to control industrial pollution. Although the main focus of the project is on strengthening the government's monitoring and enforcement agencies, the project also helps industry to mend its polluting ways through the construction of waste-treatment plants and the like. In the Philippines, a $224 million sectoral-adjustment loan was designed to deal with some of that country's most pressing environmental problems in rural areas concerning the sustainability of forests, fisheries, and upland agricultural areas. Industrial pollution in the Philippines is the target of another project still in preparation. Two projects in China, addressing urban environmental concerns (in Beijing and Liaoning), are in advanced stages of preparation."
1991,"The transformation of socialist economies has engendered a range of analytical work for the development community, generally, and for the research program of the World Bank, in particular. A World Bank seminar on ""Implementation Problems of Privatization in Eastern Europe"" was held in Yugoslavia, and six Eastern European countries and the Soviet Union participated. A review of the experience and challenges to date in trade, privatization, agriculture, finance, fiscal policy, poverty, and social safety nets, and of the Bank's activities in socialist Europe, is contained in the paper ""Transformation of Economies of East and Central Europe."" Research staff were heavily involved throughout the year in operational missions to Eastern and Central Europe, China, and Ethiopia."
1991,"A renewed emphasis on poverty reduction was reflected in the program and output of the research complex during the year. World Development Report 1990 focused on the circumstances and size of the poor population in developing countries, and on critical factors in poverty alleviation. The lessons of the report are being disseminated internationally and implemented in Bank policy. Seminars on the book's analysis were held in the most populous developing member countries of the Bank (China, India, and Indonesia), and the Economic Development Institute drafted a poverty training strategy that will be implemented over the next three years. Research staff are preparing a poverty handbook to guide country-assistance programs for poverty reduction, and two new research reports analyze the cost-effectiveness of government programs to alleviate poverty—""Reaching the Poor through Public Employment Schemes: Arguments, Evidence, and Lessons from South Asia"" and ""Financial Implications of Development Policies Aimed at Poverty Reduction."""
1991,China and India Show Mixed Results
1991,"China and India have recently encountered serious macro imbalances. The Gulf crisis played a significant role in India, whereas China was not as directly affected. To restore stability and accelerate growth, both countries will need to act upon their respective agendas for structural reform."
1991,"During the past two years, China's macro-economic policies have been primarily devoted to addressing inflationary conditions that peaked in 1988. Underlying these imbalances were excessive monetary expansion, rising price and enterprise subsidies, and a declining ratio of government revenue to GDP. The last two combined to raise the fiscal deficit from 0.5 percent of gross national product (GNP) in 1985 to an estimated 2.5 percent in 1988. The anti-inflationary policies that were introduced in late 1988 included administrative guidelines to cut state investment, as well as a tightening of credit expansion and interest rates. These policies proved successful, as inflation was"
1991,"Overall, the Chinese economy performed well on the external front during the period 1989-90: Partly as a result of the strong austerity program, which reduced imports, China enjoyed sizable trade and current-account surpluses in 1990. Furthermore, levels of debt, as well as the debt-service ratio, continue to be stable. While evidence of recovery is mounting, the large number of loss-making state enterprises, inventory buildup, and sluggish retail sales warrant continuing attention. The fiscal situation also remains worrisome, since central-government revenue is highly inelastic, while expenditures may expand under the pressure of financing enterprise losses, procurement of a record grain harvest in 1990, and price subsidies. These issues once again bring"
1991,"to the foreground the need for China to address, through reform, the many distortions and imbalances in its economic system."
1991,"The number of people living in absolute poverty in China has been reduced from 196 million in 1981 (about 20 percent of the population) to an estimated 67 million (6 percent of the population) by 1989. Continued progress in poverty reduction, however, will require attention both to measures that can generate sufficient productive employment opportunities for the rural poor and to reforms that will increase the flexibility of the labor market, along with policies that ensure the cost-efficient provision of basic social services to the population at large. Similarly, economic reforms that rationalize energy prices can help reduce the use of energy and other resources that currently are sources of environmental pollution."
1991,"Led by a $989 million increase in lending to China, commitments by the IBRD and IDA to the region in fiscal 1991 totaled $7,491 million, up 17 percent from last year's total."
1991,"Overall, the level of adjustment lending in Asia continued to be modest, reflecting the region's relative freedom from financial crisis. During the year, macroeconomic adjustment operations approved in past years continued to be implemented; with the exception of loans to Indonesia and the Philippines, no new operations were approved. Two important studies of macroeconomic management were recently completed for China and India, while an analysis of adjustment and the role of the private sector was discussed with the government of Sri Lanka."
1991,"In China, rationalization of the state-owned sector is being addressed by two projects: a rural industrial-technology operation and an urban industrial-restructuring project. In Sri Lanka, the Bank is supporting an aggressive public-sector privatization and restructuring program through recent analytical work and a $120 million IDA credit that supports the commercialization and privatization of public manufacturing enterprises. In Korea, a health-technology project will onlend $60 million to private hospitals for expansion of capacity to treat chronic and degenerative diseases."
1991,"In the areas of poverty reduction and population, the region's analytical work has included a study of access by the poor to India's social services and poverty programs. A regional comparative study of population programs has also been undertaken. A study of poverty in Nepal was completed, and the Bank's first analysis of Papua New Guinea's health and population sector was discussed with the government. Lending operations included within the region's core poverty program of targeted and sectoral assistance were approved for Bangladesh, China (three operations), India, Indonesia (two loans), the Philippines (two operations), and Sri Lanka."
1991,"CHINA: IBRD—$147.1 million: IDA—$187.9 million. By improving and expanding irrigation schemes to permit greater productivity on low-yield and medium-yield areas in the North China plain, farm incomes will be increased, as will production of staple foods and cash crops. Total cost: $593 million."
1991,"CHINA: IBRD—$75 million; IDA—$200 million. About 90,000 full-time jobs will be created through a fourth rural-credit project that will provide funds to the Agricultural Bank of China and its affiliated rural-credit cooperatives for onlending to farmers, collectives, state farms, and enterprises. Technical assistance is included. Total cost: $550 million."
1991,"CHINA: IDA—$110 million. Rural incomes could double for some 630,000 poor farm families through crop diversification, increased yields, and livestock, fishery, and agroprocessing activities. In addition, about 8,500 female village farmer technicians will be recruited and trained to serve the special needs of women farmers. Total cost: $196 million."
1991,"CHINA: IDA—$64 million. Per capita incomes may increase by an average of 180 percent for 130,000 poor smallholder farm families in Sichuan and Hubei provinces through increases in production and marketability of fruit (mostly citrus) for both domestic consumption and export. Institutional support is included. Total cost: $136.9 million."
1991,"CHINA: IBRD—$150 million. Organizational and technological restructuring, as well as policy reforms, will result in greater efficiency and better domestic and international competitiveness in four of Shanghai's priority industrial subsectors—electronic components, precision and scientific instruments, printing machinery, and electrical apparatus. Total cost: $319.6 million."
1991,"CHINA: IDA—$131.2 million. Support for improved scientific training and research will continue through a project designed to increase the output of researchers, enhance the quality and productivity of research in areas relevant to long-term economic and social development, strengthen research management, provide for a"
1991,"CHINA: IBRD—$50 million; IDA—$64.3 million. Implementation in three diverse locations— Jiangsu province, Jilin province, and Chongming island, a rural county within the municipality of Shanghai—of an innovative program that has made a strong start in upgrading levels of technology and management in rural, nonstate enterprises will be supported. Cofinancing is expected from Japan ($1.7 million). Total cost: $222.1 million."
1991,"CHINA: IBRD—$100 million: IDA—$53.6 million. The most serious constraints posed by Jiangsu province's inadequate transport infrastructure on its fast-developing economy will be mitigated. In addition, the province will be assisted in upgrading the planning, budgeting, and implementation of transport works and in developing more efficient construction entities. Technical assistance is included. Total cost: $312.8 million."
1991,"CHINA: IBRD—$79.4 million; IDA—$89 million. This first integrated urban-development project in China, which will introduce a wide range of improvements in planning, management, and design techniques based on conditions relevant to the country, will directly benefit, through the upgrading of urban services, about 1.8 million people living in the cities of Changzhou, Luoyang, and Shashi. Total cost: $277.2 million."
1991,"CHINA: IDA—$77.8 million. The government of Liaoning province will be assisted in the initial phase of a long-term investment program aimed at addressing the shortages and poor quality of water supply in the three cities of Shenyang, Fuxin, and Yingkou, as well as shortcomings in urban transport in Shenyang. Technical assistance and training are included. Total cost: $128.6 million."

Bank research staff worked jointly with the Chinese Systems Reform Commission to stage a week-long symposium, ""Alternative Forms of Public Sector Ownership."" A review of the experience of seven countries was incorporated in the paper ""Enterprise Reform and Privatization in Socialist Economies."" Several other papers on public-sector management were completed, including policy studies on the history of tax systems in developing countries, tax reform, management of urban development, and technology development in East Asia."

1991,"In many respects, 1990 was a year of setbacks for the global economy. The longest postwar run of economic expansion in the industrialized countries appears to have ended in 1990-91, as the economies of the major industrial countries slowed and as North America and the United Kingdom slipped into recession. The growth in the volume of world trade, which had already slowed to 7.5 percent in 1989 from 9 percent in 1988, continued its downward trend and was only 5 percent in 1990. Moreover, the easing of oil prices, which characterized much of the past decade, was abruptly interrupted by the Gulf crisis that followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait."
1991,Other noteworthy events during the year included the inconclusive state of the Uruguay Round of the multilateral trade negotiations under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and instability in West Asia in the aftermath of the Gulf war.
1991,"half of the year adversely affected the growth of the majority of African countries that are oil importers. Nigeria, however, appears to have been a major beneficiary during 1990 of improvement in the terms of trade. The current preliminary estimate for growth in sub-Saharan Africa over the entire year is 1.1 percent. In per capita terms, this translates into a negative growth rate of 2.1 percent. The investment and saving rates were also very low (15.8 percent"
1991,"The European countries in the region— Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and especially Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia—experienced negative growth rates because of several factors, both domestic and external. The domestic factors come primarily from the disruptions characteristic of the transitional, but possibly long-drawn-out, phase these economies are going through as they attempt to restructure their current economic system toward one that is more market-based. The external factors, apart from the repercussions of the Gulf crisis, include the decline in regional trade, the movement toward increased convertible-currency trade, and the shortfall in the production and export of oil in the Soviet Union."
1991,"The GDP growth rate was also stagnant in the Latin America and the Caribbean region, with a sharply negative performance in per capita terms. Moreover, it was the only region in 1990 to have a positive resource balance. The economic situation in Argentina, Brazil, and Peru continued to be precarious, with Brazil and Peru having a particularly dismal year owing to a severe terms-of-trade shock. Their experience underscores the importance of reducing the debt overhang before political support for a sustainable structural-reform program is further eroded. While Chile's growth rate (1.8 percent) showed a sharp decline from its 1989 high (about 10 percent), the outlook is for sustained growth at respectable rates of 4 percent to 5 percent a year. Mexico's growth"
1991,"reduction, and, notwithstanding the impact of adverse terms of trade on some severely indebted, middle-income countries (Cote dTvoire and the Philippines, for example), the strong export performance of many of the severely indebted, middle-income countries (Costa Rica and Mexico, for example)."
1991,"The limited access of developing countries to external resources continues to be a vexing problem. Although net flows of resources to developing countries have recently increased, they have been absorbed by interest payments, by profit remittances, and, more recently, by purchases of collateral, by debt buybacks, and by debt-equity swaps, leaving little to finance additional imports. In fact, in a reversal of the trend prior to the 1980s, developing countries as a group have been running a surplus in trade in goods and nonfactor services with the high-income industrial countries."
1991,Trends in World Trade
1991,"In 1990, the volume of world merchandise trade increased by 5 percent, a deceleration from the 7.5 percent expansion in world trade in 1989 (see Table 2-8). The value in U.S. dollars of world merchandise trade, inflated by the weakening of the dollar against European currencies, expanded by 13 percent to a record level of $3,470 billion. The value of trade in commercial services also expanded significantly, by 12 percent, to $770 billion. Preliminary figures indicate that, as of December 1990, for most countries, the effect of the Gulf crisis on merchandise trade was minimal; it did substantially affect the trade in commercial services, particularly air transport, however. Several countries were adversely affected by a"
1991,"Increases in the value of exports were dominated by above-average growth in Western Europe (up 19.5 percent), in the OPEC countries (up 25.5 percent), and China (up 18 percent). The expansion of trade by value in Western Europe, which accounts for 47 percent of world exports, was mainly caused by a weaker dollar, while increases in the value of OPEC exports, accounting for 5 percent of world exports, resulted from the rise in crude-oil prices. In the developing regions, export growth was above average in Africa and Asia, but below the world average in Latin America (mainly the result of a contraction in Brazil's exports). Trends in commodity prices were the driving force behind many developing countries' growth of exports."
1991,The most important of the institutional developments related to international trade concerned the Uruguay Round of the multilateral trade negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
1991,"The negotiations seek further trade liberalization through reductions in tariffs and non-tariff barriers. They are also attempting to reinforce trading discipline; to extend the coverage of international rules to sectors, such as"
1991,"agriculture and textiles and clothing, previously excluded from normal GATT rules, and to new areas such as services, to trade-related investment measures, and to intellectual property; and to strengthen the institutional basis of the GATT. The result of these endeavors will shape the trading system for many years to come."
1991,"The interests at stake for developing countries are considerable. A recent report, prepared by the staffs of the Bank and the IMF, documents the effects that numerous agricultural and industrial policies—including domestic subsidy and price-support programs, as well as tariffs, quotas, and other nontariff barriers to trade—have on developing countries. Although it is difficult to put a precise number on these effects, several studies have concluded that the annual costs in forgone income to the developing countries amount to about twice the annual interest they pay on their public external debt and are about twice the annual volume of the official development assistance they receive from the industrial countries —although the benefits may differ substantially from one country to another."
1991,"At the meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee in Brussels during the week of December 3, 1990, ministers failed to reach agreement on the conclusion of the negotiations. Several outstanding issues remained, the most prominent of which is liberalization in the agricultural sector. Following the suspension of negotiations in December 1990, the director-general of the GATT conducted a series of informal discussions to reengage the negotiations. As a result of those discussions, participants agreed to conduct negotiations on agriculture to achieve specific binding commitments in each of three areas: domestic support, market access, and export subsidies. With this breakthrough, the Trade Negotiations Committee met in February 1991 and resumed the negotiations."
1991,"The impasse on agriculture has slowed progress and prevented the conclusion of agreements in the other areas covered in the negotiations. The resolution of many of these outstanding issues would appear to hinge on substantive progress being made on agriculture. Furthermore, the developing countries—which have participated more actively in these multilateral trade negotiations than ever before—are reluctant to make concessions in several areas until there is tangible progress on issues of importance to them, including textiles. Although the broad outlines of a consensus had emerged toward the end of 1990 on plans to phase out the Multi-Fibre Arrangement's regime of textile trade restric-"
1991,"By mid September 1990, staff analysis of the effects of the crisis indicated that many developing countries would be seriously affected, at least in the near term, primarily as a result of higher oil prices (these are the MSA, or most seriously affected, countries). In addition, some ten or so countries (the Mil, or most immediately impacted, countries) were immediately affected by losses in revenue from tourism, workers' remittances, trade and related services, and Iraqi debt service, as well as by substantial reflows of workers who would need to be resettled.1"
1991,"quick action by MSA countries in raising domestic energy prices and introducing revenue-enhancing measures helped to limit the fiscal impact of the oil shock. Many uncertainties nevertheless remain over the pace of recovery, especially in Eastern and Central Europe, where increased petroleum prices have added to the financial burden of countries already experiencing serious terms-of-trade and trade-volume losses because of the breakdown of the arrangements among the members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, as well as difficulties caused by their transition to market economies."
1991,"The Mil countries, particularly the ""frontline"" states of Egypt, Jordan, and Turkey, were most seriously affected by the crisis, notwithstanding emergency financial assistance to them from the international community. Significant losses were also incurred by a number of countries heavily dependent on migrants' remittances and/or trade (Bangladesh, India, Lebanon, Morocco, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Yemen, for instance). The adverse effect on tourism was also great in countries such as Egypt, Morocco, and Turkey."
1991,"Most countries have opted for rapid economic transformation towards a market economy and have experienced difficulties as production declined and unemployment rose. (See Box 3-1 for details of a study that analyzed reform efforts in the Soviet Union.) This has been particularly marked in Poland. In addition, these countries have been hit by a number of exogenous shocks—including the breakdown in trade arrangements of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA), the in-"
1991,"The breakdown in CMEA trade arrangements occurred in two stages. In the first stage, it was decided that prices for goods traded would be set equal to world market prices, and payment would be made in convertible currency starting January 1, 1991. This decision caused a substantial deterioration in the terms of trade of the Eastern and Central European countries vis-a-vis the Soviet Union, as they had previously benefited from low-priced energy imports from the Soviet Union."
1991,"In the second stage, the political situation in the Soviet Union led to a disruption of centrally negotiated bilateral trade arrangements. With bilateral arrangements decentralized to the enterprise level, substantial uncertainty emerged regarding both the competitive advantage of many traditional exports of the Eastern and Central European countries and the ability of Soviet enterprises to secure convertible currency for payment."
1991,"3 In addition, the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates) are establishing a program to support development in the Arab countries. This program will put special emphasis on the promotion of trade and private-sector activities, as well as on economic reform."
1991,"Six areas were targeted in the management of the IBRD's liquid-assets investments: (1) development of efficient benchmark portfolios, new products, and new trading models; (2) further improvement of its risk-management systems; (3) creation of a global money-markets group to focus internationally on cash management and credit-risk monitoring; (4) expanded diversification of fixed-income trading approaches to include mortgage-backed securities, volatility trading, intermarket spread trades, long-term positioning, covered forward trading in the money markets, and computer-guided trading, as well as resuscitation of bills, agencies, and strips trading; (5) the tightening of credit criteria regarding commercial banks and securities-dealer counterparties; and (6) provision of financial technical assistance to developing member countries and the promo-"
1991,"In fiscal 1991, the OED sent eight studies to the board. Topics included the Bank's assistance for trade-policy reform and for structural adjustment in a range of borrower countries; support for industrialization in semi-industrialized countries; sustainability in education projects; education lending in Indonesia; lessons from Bank-supported population programs in different country circumstances; and lending for small and medium-sized industry."
1991,"The transformation of socialist economies has engendered a range of analytical work for the development community, generally, and for the research program of the World Bank, in particular. A World Bank seminar on ""Implementation Problems of Privatization in Eastern Europe"" was held in Yugoslavia, and six Eastern European countries and the Soviet Union participated. A review of the experience and challenges to date in trade, privatization, agriculture, finance, fiscal policy, poverty, and social safety nets, and of the Bank's activities in socialist Europe, is contained in the paper ""Transformation of Economies of East and Central Europe."" Research staff were heavily involved throughout the year in operational missions to Eastern and Central Europe, China, and Ethiopia."
1991,"The central issues in reform of socialist economies are also similar in many aspects to those addressed for decades by the Bank in advising developing countries on economic reform. Central in these have been policies on macroeconomic adjustment, trade, and debt. Staff from the Bank and the IMF worked jointly on three research studies on the prospects for economic.growth in developing countries in the credit-constrained 1990s. These are ""The Impact of Industrial Countries' Trade, Agricultural, and Industrial Policies on Developing Countries,"" ""The Role of Foreign Direct Investment in Development,"" and ""Implementation of the Debt Strategy and Its Impact on the Development Prospects of All Severely Indebted Countries."""
1991,"The Bank has been involved in many efforts to advise on reform, negotiations, and international agreements on trade. A recently completed project, ""Trade Reforms in SALs: A Positive Analysis of Performance and Sustainability,"" analyzed the trade-offs between short-run performance and longer-term distribution, investment, and revenue effects. The Bank and the U.S. Department of Agriculture cosponsored a conference, ""EC 1992: Implica-"
1991,"tions for World Food and Agricultural Trade."" Another joint conference, ""The European Community and the Caribbean in the 1990s,"" discussed the European Community's Single Market Act, the Lome IV Convention negotiations, the Uruguay Round negotiations, and changes in Eastern European markets, and the implications of these events and circumstances for developing countries. The results of the research project, ""Industrial Competition, Productive Efficiency, and Their Relation to Trade Regimes,"" were disseminated at conferences at the National Bureau of Economic Research, the World Institute for Development Economics Research, and Harvard and Georgetown Universities."
1991,"The annual ministerial-level meeting of the OECD in early June and the twice-yearly meetings of the OECD's Economic Policy Committee, which focus on industrial-country concerns such as economic recovery, inflation, competition, trade, public expenditures, and unemployment, are important fora in which the Bank can point out how various industrial-country policies affect developing countries."
1991,"The overall economic situation in sub-Sa-haran Africa (SSA) remains difficult. For many countries, the external environment continues to be hostile, as reflected by the adverse effects of debt overhang, capricious weather, sluggish growth in export demand, and steady declines in terms of trade. A few countries are even suffering internal strife and famine conditions."
1991,"Agricultural output in the countries of the Sahel increased by only 1 percent, as rainfall distribution was poor in a number of countries, particularly Burkina Faso and Niger. Aggregate export volumes increased by over 9 percent, rebounding strongly from a decline in 1989. As a result of this strong export performance, and despite a small deterioration in the terms of trade, the aggregate current-account deficit of the eight countries declined slightly, from 13.4 percent of GDP in 1989 to 12.1 percent in 1990. Developments over the past year continue to underline the inherent fragility of the Sahelian economies and their great sensitivity to, and dependence on, external factors. In fiscal 1991, the Bank focused its attention on addressing long-term growth issues, particularly human-resource development, poverty alleviation, natural-resource management, and the enabling environment for private-sector development. Debt issues also continued to receive particular attention, and debt-reduction packages, the first to make use of the Debt Reduction Facility for IDA-only Countries, were approved and successfully implemented in Niger and Mozambique.1"
1991,"Cote d'lvoire's continued macroeconomic and financial crises—whose root causes lie in a large structural deficit, a lack of competitiveness in the productive sectors, and adverse movements of terms of trade—led the government to prepare a new adjustment program for support by the Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to enable it to move towards public-finance equilibrium and reduce domestic-payment arrears. During the past year, the government had difficulties in implementing its stabilization program, but undertook structural-reform programs in the agriculture, energy, and water-supply sectors. In addition, key reforms in the financial sector, in privatization and the restructuring of public enterprises, in the regulatory and tax systems, and in human-resource development are under"
1991,"Over the past eighteen months, the government of Sierra Leone, in consultation with the IMF and the World Bank, has implemented substantial reforms in its fiscal, monetary, trade, and exchange-rate policies, as well as structural changes in the mining and agricultural sectors. It has also resumed debt-service payments to both the IMF and the World Bank and cleared its payment arrears to the African Development Bank. The IMF is negotiating a rights-accumulation program, an agreement on which will open the way for the Bank to resume lending to Sierra Leone after its arrears to the Bank are settled."
1991,"Eastern and Central Africa. Although the overall growth rate of this subregion was close to zero in 1990, some countries did quite well. Uganda has remained a strong, consistent reformer since 1987, and its growth performance continues to be impressive. Overall, GDP growth has been between 6 percent and 7 percent, reflecting a marked recovery in both agricultural production and manufacturing output. In 1990, however, growth fell below 5 percent, and the terms of trade worsened, the result of drought, rising oil prices, and falling coffee exports. The government continued to pursue significant fiscal and monetary reforms to ensure a continued strong performance of the economy. In mid 1990, the parallel market for foreign exchange was legalized—a policy step that will help export growth. In addition, fiscal adjustment is being pursued through several expenditure measures—such as the elimination of ""ghost"" workers and the reduction of temporary workers—and through a reduction of unwarranted tax exemptions."
1991,"The GDP growth rate of Kenya also fell below 5 percent during 1990 as terms of trade worsened, oil prices rose, and receipts from tourism dried up. The government continues to pursue a flexible exchange-rate policy and tighter fiscal and monetary measures."
1991,"fiscal and balance-of-payments imbalances. Its growth rate has been over 4.5 percent during 1980-89, and its recent slowdown in growth (3.3 percent in 1990) is attributable to deteriorating terms of trade and drought-related stagnation in agricultural production."
1991,"pioneering step towards the long-term conservation of its environment by integrating a national environment-action plan with an ongoing adjustment program supported by the Bank and the IMF. In Zimbabwe, GDP growth fell to 4 percent in 1990 (compared with an average of 5.7 percent in the previous two years), and inflation increased from 10 percent to 16 percent. In response to these troublesome events, the government initiated a comprehensive economic-reform program designed to move the economy away from regulation and control toward greater reliance on market forces. The economic-reform program combines trade liberalization, tariff reform, fiscal adjustment, public-enterprise reform, a relaxation of domestic controls, and the loosening of labor-market restrictions with appropriate exchange-rate and monetary policies."
1991,"Tanzania and Mozambique continued their resolute implementation of adjustment programs. The Tanzanians pursued reforms in key areas (such as trade liberalization) and sectors (agricultural, industrial, and financial). Gross domestic product grew by more than 4 percent in 1990, the fifth consecutive year of increased per capita income. Inflation, which reached 30 percent in 1989, declined to about 20 percent. Although Mozambique continued to demonstrate a firm commitment to implementing its economic-reform program and to moving towards a multiparty system, GDP growth was only 3.1 percent because of several adverse external factors (in particular, high oil prices, adverse weather, and internal strife). In Zambia, considerable progress was made in implementing the government's year-old economic-reform program, especially in decontrolling domestic prices, lowering the budget deficit, liberalizing international trade, and moving to a market-determined exchange rate. Although Zambia's GDP growth in 1990 was low (only 1 percent), with continued reforms and favorable weather conditions, the outlook for economic recovery seems brighter than at any point in the past decade. Good progress in regularizing its position with bilateral and multilateral donors was also made during the year: With arrears to the Bank cleared in March 1991, an IDA credit, the first since 1987, was approved."
1991,"The long-term perspective study also clearly identified closer regional integration as a key ingredient for stronger growth over the long run. The Bank is now processing an operation to provide closer economic integration among countries that are members of the Central African Customs and Economic Union (Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon). The Bank is also working with the Economic Community of West African States on a study of barriers to trade and factor movements"
1991,"Achieving closer economic integration is a long-term endeavor. While it is vital to have a clear statement of objectives at the outset— monetary integration, for example—the process itself will consist of many small steps by countries, such as standardizing trade procedures and simplifying financial transactions (including investment), as well as greater harmonization of domestic economic policies and lowering of trade barriers. The process of adjustment currently ongoing in many countries of the region offers useful opportunities for such harmonization to take place."
1991,"Korea's prospects remain tied to the evolution of its competitiveness in terms of labor costs and access to technology. Despite a balance-of-payments deficit and an inflation rate that was higher than in the mid 1980s, growth in 1990 was about 9 percent. Thailand's economy continued its double-digit growth performance in 1990. Manufacturing expanded rapidly, and, with vigorous promotion, exports from this sector have grown significantly as a share of merchandise trade and gross domestic product (GDP). Exports of manufactures have helped to rectify basic imbalances on both the fiscal and external accounts and to lower the debt-service ratio on long-term debt, further enhancing Thailand's creditworthiness. Bottlenecks, however, have been felt in the power, telecommunications, and transport sectors, while rapid industrialization has contributed to growing air and water pollution and related health problems."
1991,"Indonesia, while benefiting from higher oil prices over the past year, continued to implement the structural-adjustment program that it began in 1983. Measures introduced in 1990 involved additional efforts to deregulate the economy and promote the private sector. Major reforms were announced in the financial sector, involving the phasing out of subsidized credit, and in the trade sector, involving further reductions in nontariff barriers, tariffs, and export restrictions. In parallel with trade-policy reform, the government intensified its efforts to improve domestic incentives and the regulatory environment by extending deregulation in investment procedures to agriculture and the pharmaceutical industry."
1991,"Overall, the Chinese economy performed well on the external front during the period 1989-90: Partly as a result of the strong austerity program, which reduced imports, China enjoyed sizable trade and current-account surpluses in 1990. Furthermore, levels of debt, as well as the debt-service ratio, continue to be stable. While evidence of recovery is mounting, the large number of loss-making state enterprises, inventory buildup, and sluggish retail sales warrant continuing attention. The fiscal situation also remains worrisome, since central-government revenue is highly inelastic, while expenditures may expand under the pressure of financing enterprise losses, procurement of a record grain harvest in 1990, and price subsidies. These issues once again bring"
1991,"need to manage this crisis with skill and dispatch, while also addressing the many structural-reform issues inhibiting growth in the economy. The onset of serious macroeconomic difficulties, accompanied by continuing political uncertainties, has already exerted a dampening effect on the progress of key economic-policy reforms to deregulate industry, liberalize the trade regime, and improve the overall environment for private-sector activity."
1991,"Over the past year, a number of external and domestic developments adversely affected Nepal's economic performance. Although the trade-and-transit treaty impasse with India was resolved in June 1990, its effects lingered on; the Gulf crisis directly increased import costs of oil and slowed receipts from tourism; and in early 1990, Nepal underwent a major political transformation from an absolute to a constitutional monarchy."
1991,"Over the past year, the government of Papua New Guinea made good progress in implementing the financial-stabilization and structural-adjustment program that it embarked on in early 1990 in response to the closure of the Bougainville copper mine and a sharp deterioration of its external terms of trade. Prompt adjustments in macroeconomic policies allowed the domestic and external financial impact of these shocks to be effectively contained. At the same time, measures were undertaken to improve public-resource management and reform the incentive and regulatory framework to spur the development of the private sector. The central objective of this program of structural reform is to promote the development of the nonmining economy to underpin sustained and more broadly based growth of income and employment over the medium term. As a result of the shocks felt by the economy and the adjustments made in response to them, GDP fell by about 1.5 percent in 1990; however, it is expected to rebound strongly in 1991, supported by the development of new mineral operations and advances in the nonmining economy (growth in the nonmining economy is projected to rise to 3.5 percent a year during 1992-95)."
1991,"For the Eastern and Central European economies, the Gulf crisis exacerbated the disruption in trade and payments arising from the loss of exports to the Soviet Union and a deterioration in terms of trade resulting from the elimination of the CMEA. It is estimated that the impact of these shocks will be about $20 billion in calendar year 1991. It is not surprising, therefore, that under the weight of both strong stabilization efforts and a large negative shock, GDP levels in Eastern and Central Europe fell by 10 percent in 1990 and are expected to show a further decline of 5 percent in 1991. Strong growth in Turkey, Pakistan, and the Maghreb countries helped to limit the decline in the regionwide GDP to less than 2 percent."
1991,"Algeria also embarked on some key institutional and political reforms. While the domestic political situation continues to evolve, the government remains committed to holding the country's first multiparty national legislative elections since independence. Key institutional reforms included the adoption of a new money and credit law, as well as several laws pertaining to the labor market. The money and credit laws granted the central bank full autonomy to formulate and implement monetary, external-debt, and foreign-exchange policies. It also removed controls on foreign direct investment in most sectors, allowing, among other things, 100 percent foreign ownership of new investment projects and unrestricted joint ventures between foreign concerns and Algeria's private sector. In preparation for trade liberalization, the central bank devalued the dinar by about 100 percent between mid November 1990 and the end of April 1991. In April 1991, Algeria introduced a major liberalization of its external trade that complements the already far-reaching measures taken to liberalize domestic trade. The new labor legislation lays the groundwork for a more competitive labor market, allowing the creation of autonomous labor unions and specifying procedures for the resolution of labor-management disputes."
1991,"For Jordan, the year began on an optimistic note, with the government pressing ahead with its adjustment program, which was being supported by an International Monetary Fund (IMF) standby arrangement, agreements with the Paris and London Clubs, and a $150 million industry and trade-policy adjustment loan from the Bank. Further progress was made in early 1990 towards reduction of the budget deficit, when prices for water and electricity were selectively increased and a program to reduce food subsidies was launched."
1991,"The Republic of Yemen, formed in May 1990 through unification of the Yemen Arab Republic and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, inherited all the economic difficulties of its two constituent parts: an unsustainable budget deficit, a structural balance-of-payments deficit, intense inflationary pressures, and rising unemployment. These difficulties were aggravated by the process of amalgamating two governmental administrations and the additional expenses associated with it, as well as by the Gulf crisis. The crisis resulted in the return home of some 750,000 Yemenis (migrant workers and their children), whose remittances have been the most important source of foreign exchange for Yemen in the past two decades. It also significantly reduced external trade in goods and services, as well as external assistance to the country."
1991,"In response to the deteriorating situation, the government has recently taken a number of steps to stabilize the economy, the most important of which relate to some liberalization of the foreign-trade and exchange regime, whereby import licensing was relaxed and private-exchange markets were freed from government controls. The government also doubled the price of gasoline and raised by 50 percent the price of diesel fuel. These measures, although significant, have not yet led to improvements in the economic conditions of the country. Preliminary data indicate that no economic growth took place in 1990. The government has agreed to work with IDA to formulate a medium-term economic framework that would satisfy the requirement for the restoration of viable macroeconomic stability over the medium term."
1991,"The dramatic social and political changes that are occurring in Eastern and Central Europe show that the countries in this subregion are committed to a thorough transformation of their economic systems. The transformation process—which includes macroeconomic stabilization; reform of incentives and price systems; enterprise reform, privatization, and financial-sector development; the abolition of state monopolies on foreign trade, foreign exchange, and production; the installation of"
1991,"Bulgaria, which is especially dependent on CMEA trade, particularly with the Soviet Union, experienced severe terms-of-trade, export-market, and payments-disruption losses that were estimated to be about 18 percent of GDP in 1990. Consequently, the current-account deficit widened substantially, even with a further decline in import volumes, and output fell by a steep 12 percent."
1991,"In January 1991, Czechoslovakia's transformation program was intensified. A balanced budget and a tight monetary policy were pursued to maintain macroeconomic stability and support structural adjustment. Foreign trade and prices were liberalized; a privatization program, covering thousands of small retail outlets and service enterprises, was launched, and one for medium-sized and large enterprises was at an advanced stage of preparation; and a social safety net to protect the people most adversely affected by the transition to a market economy was being put in place. The government's program is being supported by an IMF standby arrangement, as well as by a $450 million structural-adjustment loan from the Bank. The government's reform program is also being supported by the European Community and the group of twenty-four industrial-"
1991,"secured an IMF standby arrangement, as well as a $300 million structural-adjustment loan from the Bank, and was able to negotiate a Paris Club rescheduling of foreign debts. Initial results of the economic-transformation program are promising: Prices are now freely determined, and most barriers to international trade have been removed. Inflation has slowed; nonetheless, it remains excessive (between 5 percent and 6 percent a month) and continues to be the main threat to the program. The program also resulted in a large trade surplus due to strong export expansion and reserve accumulation, a sharp drop in GDP (-12 percent), a budgetary surplus of more than 3 percent of GDP in 1990, and a rise in unemployment to an estimated 6.1 percent."
1991,"By the third quarter of 1990, inflation reappeared, and trade performance weakened in the wake of a deterioration in the implementation of stabilization policies. While inflation decelerated in the fourth quarter following a tightening of monetary policy, other economic indicators continued to deteriorate. Industrial output declined steeply as retail sales slumped. Meanwhile, the Gulf crisis had a far-reaching negative effect, not only through higher oil prices but also through losses of export contracts and payments, including workers' remittances. For the year as a whole, industrial production declined by 10 percent, and the gross social product fell by 7.2 percent. The rate of inflation soared to 118 percent (against a 20-30 percent rate planned under the program). The current account with convertible-currency countries had a deficit of $1 billion, compared with an initially projected surplus of $1 billion, and foreign-exchange reserves declined to about $7 billion. In Yugoslavia, any significant economic recovery is now linked to the resolution of political difficulties."
1991,"In some cases, growth is low or negative because countries have only very recently begun to undertake major stabilization and adjustment programs; in other cases, it is low because restructuring has not yet taken place. For example, in Argentina and Peru, negative growth is the product of hyperinflation and the initial impact of stabilization efforts. Significant structural reforms, including restructuring of the public sector and trade liberalization, have just begun and have had an initial negative effect on growth. In Chile, rapid growth during both 1988 and 1989 was accompanied by"
1991,"In general, reforms in the first group of countries have covered such areas as reduction of tariffs and elimination of quantitative restrictions on foreign trade, liberalization of financial-sector regulations (including controls on interest rates), privatization of public enterprises, and appropriate adjustment in taxes, public-sector prices, and expenditures to reduce public-sector deficits."
1991,"In the second group, the changes under way in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela are probably the most substantial. In Venezuela, key prices, such as exchange and interest rates, have been freed, subsidies have been heavily curtailed, trade is being liberalized, a reform of public enterprises and the financial system is in progress, the public-sector deficit has been virtually eliminated, and an agreement reducing debt service to commercial banks has been implemented. In Colombia, the government has decided to open the economy, deregulate and reform public enterprises, and liberalize the financial system. The first steps in each have already been taken. In both Venezuela and Colombia, the combination of a rich natural-resource base and recent policy reforms makes for very favorable growth prospects."
1991,"jor public enterprises is a key element in the reform program. The program of privatization and debt-equity conversion has already reduced Argentina's commercial debt by $7 billion, or about 20 percent of its long-term debt to commercial banks. In addition, a program of tax reform is being implemented, and the fiscal deficit has been reduced sharply. Government expenditures are being cut through administrative reforms and an early-retirement scheme for government workers. The financial system is gradually being rehabilitated, and interest rates are now set by market forces. In foreign trade, quantitative restrictions have largely been eliminated, and the maximum tariff has been lowered to 24 percent. In Brazil, the government has reduced the fiscal deficit of the central government, and public employment has been cut. Trade reform has eliminated most quantitative trade restrictions and will reduce tariffs. Inflation remains high, however, and the government has been unable to control monetary expansion."
1991,"Peru has suffered a significant erosion of economic institutions, policies, and infrastructure during the past several years. Since August 1990, the new government has been implementing a major stabilization and adjustment program designed to deal with inflation through more restrictive monetary and fiscal policies, as well as to liberalize foreign trade and deregulate the economy. Payments of current debt service to multilateral institutions (including the World Bank) have been resumed, and, as a result, arrears to international organizations have been frozen. Although the initial effect of the new economic policies has been positive, Peru still faces daunting problems, particularly in consolidating its stabilization effort, rebuilding the base of infrastructure, restoring social services, and finding solutions to deal with arrears owed to foreign creditors. While the new economic program has balanced the budget and reduced inflation considerably, inflation remains high (over 300 percent a year)."
1991,"process are somewhat better. Far-reaching changes to improve macroeconomic management, deregulate economies, and liberalize external trade have been initiated, and steps have been taken to reduce the burden of adjustment on the poor."
1991,"In Jamaica, the government has advanced the reform agenda in recent years. Trade is being further liberalized, the role of the public sector is being reduced, interest-rate subsidies are being eliminated, and the exchange-rate system is now market-based."
1991,"Third, domestic and external economic management are both highly interdependent and mutually reinforcing. Thus, programs of public-sector restructuring have to be combined with programs for liberalizing trade and resolving external-debt problems. In Argentina and Brazil, for instance, early efforts at reform were undertaken while external-trade restrictions and distorted incentive regimes were maintained, both of which added to domestic inflationary pressures. At the same time, the absence of an agreement with external creditors increased skepticism about the success of stabilization programs. In contrast, reform programs in Bolivia, Chile, and Mexico have all been accompanied by workouts with commercial banks that reduce debt-service burdens."
1991,Debt and Trade
1991,"Some progress was also made during the year in strengthening regional trading arrangements. Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay agreed in July 1990 to establish a full common market (Mercosur) by the end of 1994, two years ahead of the original target. Although the Mercosur was preceded by several unsuccessful attempts at regional integration, prospects for success are better now, given the rapid increase in trade among these countries since 1985 and the strong commitment to liberalization and deregulation in the region."
1991,"Mexico began negotiations in 1991 with the United States and Canada, its most important trading partners, for the possible establishment of a free-trade agreement among the participating countries. Chile is making preparations to begin similar negotiations. Under the Enterprise for the Americas program, the United States has indicated its willingness to broaden this approach to cover other countries in the region, with the eventual goal of establishing a comprehensive free-trade agreement for all of Latin America. The enterprise initiative will also provide additional support for privatization, liberalization of investment regimes, and debt reduction, largely funneled through the Inter-American Development Bank."
1991,"Other initiatives aimed at establishing free-trade areas in the region include those of the Andean Pact (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela), which plans to achieve an almost total free-trade area among its members beginning in January 1992; the Group of Three (Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela), which is negotiating an agreement on trade and investment aimed at the liberalization of trade and deregulation among its three members; and Chile, Mexico, and Venezuela, which began negotiations in 1990 on ways to achieve free trade in the near term."
1991,"Structural-adjustment loans in El Salvador and Honduras supported major reforms in trade liberalization and public-expenditure redirection. In El Salvador, the Bank's structural-adjustment loan is supporting a program of economic revival and poverty reduction that is being put in place despite the problems associated with a decade-long civil conflict. Lending to Honduras was suspended in 1989, and the country was placed in nonaccrual status. The installation of a new government in 1990, however, led to the definition of a new program of adjustment, the clearing of arrears to"

1991,"The largest source of cofinancing in fiscal 1991 continued to be official bilateral and multilateral development institutions, which, together, accounted for $7,057 million, down from $9,307 million in fiscal 1990. This is attributable primarily to a slowdown in operations as a result of the Gulf crisis and delay in certain large cofinanced operations because of prolonged negotiations on debt issues and other difficult policy matters. Official cofinancing from Japan, through the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund and the Export-Import Bank of Japan, continued to account for the largest share of official cofinancing in support of Bank-assisted operations. Cofinancing from the two agencies aggregated $1,405 million equivalent for twelve projects approved in fiscal 1991."
1991,"During the year, the volume of cofinancing to countries in the region was $2.1 billion for twenty-one projects, a drop from the unusually high level of the year before. The IDB was the region's largest source of cofinancing during the year. Cofinancing arrangements with the IDB included fourteen operations for a total of $1.4 billion. Japan remained the largest source of official bilateral cofinancing through the Export-Import Bank of Japan (three operations for a total of $275 million) and the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (two operations for $85 million). An export-credit enhanced leverage (EXCEL) program for up to $300 million for the export-sector loan to Mexico is being discussed with export-credit agencies."

IDA was most active in India ($673 million for six projects), China ($442 million for five projects), and Bangladesh ($266 million for four projects)."
1985,"GDP growth. GDP growth in developing countries was 3.8 percent in 1984, largely led by strong performance in Asia (see Table 2-2). Among the low-income countries in that region, China registered an impressive increase in GDP, the result mainly of economic reforms that have increased the efficiency of Chinese agriculture (which was also aided by good weather), and of a strong export performance (up 15 percent from 1983). India's GDP rose by about 5.5 percent, short of the 7.7 percent achieved in 1983, but still well above both the rate of population growth and the historical average. The Republic of Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore also posted impressive gains in income, resulting mainly from large increases in exports. Despite its relatively large debt and stagnation in oil prices, Indonesia, too, achieved strong growth in GDP, together with rice self-sufficiency, fruits of recent rigorous adjustment measures and of longstanding agricultural efforts, respectively. The"
1985,"Manufactured exports from developing countries increased by over 14 percent in 1984, in contrast to the rise of primary exports by less than 5 percent. In general, the principal beneficiaries of the export boom were countries that could quickly take advantage of opportunities afforded by increased demand for manufactures. These included middle-income countries that have built a large manufacturing sector (Korea and Brazil, for instance), some poorer countries that have achieved remarkable success in manufactured exports since the early 1970s (Sri Lanka, for example), and China, whose manufactured exports have skyrocketed recently."
1985,"Much of even this small increase in imports was accounted for by two countries, India and China. Most of the debt of the former is on concessional terms, while that of the latter is small."
1985,"EDI is also expanding and strengthening the evaluation of its activities. In addition to leading a review of ESAMI, EDI conducted a review of its joint training program with The West African Center for Training and Banking Studies of the Central Bank for the West African States (CO-FEB). The Operations Evaluation Department (OED) of the World Bank is planning to expand substantially its contribution towards strengthening the evaluation of EDI's work. OED will collaborate with EDI in fiscal year 1986 on a comprehensive evaluation of EDI's training program in China, which began in 1980 and is now EDI's largest national program. OED will review end-of-course/seminar evaluation reports that EDI produces and select a sample each year as the basis for a special annual report. OED's reviews of Bank operations will contain assessments of the effect that EDI training has had on the performance of agencies from which officials have received training. OED also plans to collaborate with EDI in an evaluation of EDI's five-year plan at its mid point in fiscal year 1987. These actions by OED will add a useful dimension to the independent review of EDI's work."
1985,"A number of new projects are concerned with questions relating to the interrelationships between institutions and incentives. One project will develop a methodology for evaluating the effects on demography and health of upgrading projects in low-income urban neighborhoods; the issues of cost recovery in the context of support programs for agriculture are the focus of another project, with a case study of rubber replanting programs in Thailand; in a study of the role of risk in Sahelian agriculture, farm technology and farmers' production behavior will be investigated to help improve the knowledge of the factors influencing farmers' decisions, knowledge that is crucial in the design of farm and food policies. The relative costs of various types of secondary education in Shanghai are the subject of a collaborative research project between the Bank and Fudan University as part of a larger effort to address questions that lie at the heart of policy formulation for technical and vocational education in China. In the area of the international economic environment, a project will examine the role of foreign aid and other capital flows on investment; another project deals with the relationships between performance indicators and monitorable policy instruments to help in the design of medium-term programs in the context of debt rescheduling."
1985,"Among the larger amounts of technical assistance financed as components of Bank loans and credits were $10.14 million of a $22 million agriculture credit to Ethiopia, $6.62 of a $16.4 million public-enterprise rehabilitation credit to Mauritania, $143.9 million of a $160 million transmigration loan to Indonesia, and $13.63 million of a $56 million agricultural loan to Chile. Also included in this category are sectoral technical-assistance or engineering loans or credits to Malaysia for agriculture; to China, Liberia, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda for energy; to Malawi and Peru for industry; to Guinea, Niger, and Uruguay for power; to the Philippines for telecommunications; to Turkey for urban development; and to Brazil and Kenya for water supply and sanitation."
1985,"In general, the economies of the East Asia and Pacific region continued their recovery from the deep international recession of the early 1980s, and, with the exception of the Philippines, economic growth in the region during 1984 exceeded 5 percent. The factors underlying economic recovery differed among countries, however. Economies heavily dependent on international trade—the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand, for example—benefited from continued growth in the industrialized world and the revival of trade, especially in manufactured goods. China continued its buoyant performance largely because of the favorable effects of its far-reaching policy reforms; the Lao People's Democratic Republic saw its economy, dependent on its agricultural sector, grow rapidly as a result of good weather; and Papua New Guinea and the small Pacific island nations experienced some recovery in their external demand."
1985,"The countries of the East Asia and Pacific region, again with the exception of the Philippines, have been much less troubled by external-debt problems than the rest of the developing world, and, in general, have retained favorable access to commercial capital. Nonetheless, save for China, the management of foreign debt remains an important policy concern in all countries, for the prospects for international economic growth are uncertain beyond 1985, and many countries still have large fiscal and current-account deficits requiring continued substantial reliance on foreign capital."
1985,"Indonesia and China continue to borrow substantially from the World Bank to finance their development programs.

Industrial output rose 16 percent, more than in any other recent year and double the 1980-83 average; agricultural production was also impressive, with grain output reaching a record 407 million metric tons and cotton production increasing by 31 percent. Government revenues increased by about 17 percent, which permitted growth in public investments to be substantial and a budgetary deficit of less than 2 percent of GDP to be maintained. Although rapid growth of demand exacerbated the shortages of energy, producer goods, and construction materials, price increases were limited by administrative controls."

1985,"Despite the increased demand from the United States, Europe improved only modestly on its poor growth performance in 1983. Real output in European industrial countries increased by only 2.3 percent. In the Federal Republic of Germany, the trade balance provided a stimulus of 1 percent of GNP, and nongovernment domestic demand about 1.7 percent; this stimulus was partly countered by the reduction in the government budget deficit of about 0.4 percent of national product. Real output in the United Kingdom grew by 2.4 percent, as increases in investment of almost 7.6 percent more than compensated for declines in the trade balance and in the government budget deficit. Italy registered an increase in GDP of 2.6 percent, as increases in consumer demand and stockbuilding were greater than the decline in the contribution of the foreign sector to income. GDP in France increased by only 1.8 percent. Continued fiscal restraint in France reduced the structural budget deficit by about 1 percent of GDP, and domestic investment fell by 2.0 percent; the foreign sector provided a net stimulus of almost 1 percent of GDP, however, and private consumption also rose."

The appreciation of the dollar, in combination with the US recovery, which outpaced the rest of the world, gave stimulus to a US current-account deficit of about $102 billion in 1984. In Japan, the current-account surplus was $35 billion, and for the European members of the OECD, it was $9 billion. The OECD as a whole ran a $65.4 billion deficit. Because of differences in accounting procedures, errors, and omissions, there is an asymmetry of almost $80 billion in the global current account, part of which is probably due to an overstatement of the size of the OECD deficit.3 Even after allowing for errors in reporting, however, it is likely that there remains a significant deficit for industrial countries as a group, as well as an imbalance among industrial countries, whose main poles are the United States, with its large deficit, and Japan, with its large surplus."
1985,"The recent years' drift towards increased protectionism continued in 1984, although the volume of world trade rose by an impressive 8.8 percent. Thus, in the United States, a growing trade deficit and high unemployment in industries that must compete with imports have fueled pressures for protectionist measures, despite the fact that protectionism would hardly improve the economy's prospects. Calls for an across-the-board import surcharge or for more discriminatory actions are now common in some sectors. In Europe, unemployment has also stimulated protectionist pressures. In most countries, constraints on agricultural trade, together with subsidies to production, remain high. High domestic interest rates, maintained in response to interest rates in the US and to stave off large capital outflows, have hindered recovery and raised several policy issues. In the face of these pressures, OECD governments have continued duly to denounce protectionism as creating, not solving, problems. Nevertheless, unless economic growth accelerates sufficiently to start reducing unemployment and purposeful steps are taken to maintain and strengthen the relatively liberal sys-"
1985,"tem of trade and financial flows that has evolved since World War II, its further erosion would seem likely."
1985,"Many developing countries, especially those in Asia and Latin America, benefited from economic recovery in the United States and the beginning of recovery elsewhere in the industrial world. In some countries, the effects of policy initiatives to remove distortions and increase economic efficiency greatly improved performance. Thus, by the dismal standards of the early 1980s, 1984 was a good year for developing countries, whose output increased by 3.8 percent. After three years of stagnation or decline, per capita income rose by 1.8 percent. Regional performance varied greatly, however. African countries suffered continued declines in GDP, Latin American countries managed some increase in GDP after declines in 1982 and 1983, and Asian countries enjoyed continued growth. Nonetheless, protectionism and the threat of further increases in trade restrictions are a major concern to the developing countries, as many continue to carry the burden of high interest rates and the added burden of adjustment."
1985,"High interest rates increased the portion of export receipts used to cover interest payments. In addition, capital flows remained low, and some build-up in reserves occurred. Therefore, despite higher exports, developing countries could achieve only a small increase in imports. Developing countries thus had a trade surplus of $14.2 billion in 1984, the first since comprehensive ba-lance-of-payments statistics have been kept."
1985,"Latin American countries' GDP increased by 2.8 percent in 1984. Although the increase in the rate of growth was a welcome break from the continuous decline in GDP since 1981, it only barely topped (by 0.2 percent) the increase in population. Unemployment increased dramatically in many areas. Much of the improvement in GDP in Latin American countries came either from increases in trade surpluses or declines in deficits, and not from any significant rise in domestic expenditures. The trade surplus of Latin American countries rose to about S40 billion, or almost 6 percent of GDP. Because Latin American countries had to use increases in output to cover interest payments and, to some extent, to reconstitute depleted reserves, they continued to"
1985,"The most hopeful development of the year consists in the continued spread, in developing countries, of the appreciation of the nature of appropriate policies and of the need to pursue them. The need for such policies would not be lessened by a more favorable international environment. However, their chances for success, and their yield in terms of growth and poverty alleviation and social progress, would be much heightened by a favorable international environment, one that provided growing import demand in a liberal trade environment, unhindered capital movements with lower real interest rates and longer maturities, and, for the poorest countries, more aid flows on concessional terms."
1985,"1985 turned largely on the situation in Africa, international trade, financial flows, and the external debt of developing countries."
1985,"The international dialogue within the UN system—at the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)—remained subdued. Attempts to reach a procedural understanding during the 1984 General Assembly session on global negotiations on economic issues failed to get general support. The international dialogue was left to be pursued in other fora. Against this background, the meetings of the Development Committee assumed significance."
1985,The Committee discussed the linkages between trade and the promotion of development. Encouragement was given for the immediate adoption of concrete measures against protectionism. The Committee welcomed the consideration being given to the role that could be played by the new GATT (General Agreement on Tar-
1985,iffs and Trade) round of multilateral trade negotiations in strengthening the trading system.
1985,"The April meeting was characterized largely by informal discussions on a range of international issues, as directed by the Committee in September 1984. The Committee emphasized the need for continued adjustment in both developed and developing countries so as to achieve sustained growth. Attention was focused on the areas of debt, trade, capital flows, and the future role of the Bank. With regard to debt, while welcoming progress made by many indebted developing countries in dealing with the debt situation, the Committee noted that a number of them continued to face debt-servicing difficulties. The Committee agreed that the continuation of adjustment efforts, supported by capital flows on appropriate terms, improved access to markets, and multiyear reschedulings, where appropriate, would assist in restoring creditworthiness. Trade-policy developments and issues were discussed in the context of their links to the prospects for growth and adjustment in developing countries. The Committee urged governments to roll back existing trade barriers and resist further protectionist measures. It also called for efforts to complete the 1982 GATT work program, which could lay the basis for the participation of all countries in the trade-negotiation round. Note was taken of the fact that a number of countries had decided to embark on multilateral trade negotiations under the auspices of the GATT."
1985,"The ten heads of state of countries that are members of the European Economic Community met on March 29 and 30, 1985, in Brussels, Belgium, under the chairmanship of Bettino Craxi, Prime Minister of Italy. The meeting completed the process of negotiation for the accession of Spain and Portugal to the EEC. The European leaders indicated support for the initiation, as soon as possible, of a new round of multilateral trade negotiations in Brussels. They also stressed the need to supplement short-term assistance to combat hunger in the world by means of medium-term and long-term structural measures, which, alone, could enable the countries concerned to achieve their requirements for food security."
1985,"The twentieth session of the Economic Commission for Africa and the eleventh meeting of the Conference of Ministers responsible for economic development and planning were held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, April 25 through 29, 1985, on the theme, ""African Economic and Social Crisis: Review, Prospects, and Perspectives."" Ministers noted that certain short-term and medium-term concerns had not yet received appropriate attention, including the maintenance of IDA resources at the level of the sixth replenishment. Priorities recommended for action at the national, subregional, and international levels included long-term structural changes in, and development of, food and agriculture, industry, infrastructure, trade and finance, natural resources, science and technology, and human resources. Action to ameliorate the effects of drought and to combat desertification was also recommended. These recommendations are to be considered by the second regular session of ECOSOC in July 1985."
1985,"The heads of state or of government of the seven major industrial nations, as well as the President of the Commission of the European Communities, met in Bonn, Federal Republic of Germany, May 2 through 4, 1985, to discuss the global economic outlook, its problems, and prospects. The participants noted that important progress had been achieved in bringing about an economic recovery and expressed their determination to work in the perspective of open multilateral trade and stable and effective monetary systems. Sustained economic recovery in the industralized world was seen as of major importance in inducing further recovery in the developing countries. Concerning the developing countries, the conferees recognized that the problem of external debt was far from solved, and in welcoming longer-term restructuring agreements between debtor countries and commercial banks, they indicated a readiness to negotiate, when appropriate, multiyear reschedulings of sovereign debt."
1985,"1. To achieve the objectives of structural-adjustment lending—reducing the current-account deficit to a sustainable level and maintaining or restoring the momentum of growth—improvements have been sought in four interrelated areas: trade policy, mobilization of domestic and foreign resources, efficiency in the use of domestic resources, and institutional reform. The precise blend of these reforms, the specific measures chosen to implement them, their timing, and the particular sector focus have depended on several factors, in particular, a country's initial economic condition and the strengths and weaknesses of its institutions. There are no general solutions; the design of adjustment programs has to be carefully tailored to meet specific needs and policy objectives of individual borrowers."
1985,"The first such multicountry study—on trade liberalization—was launched in fiscal 1984, and during the past year, two others were approved by the Research Policy Council. One study will examine the dynamics and results of agricultural price policy over time; the other will analyze the different experiences of growth and income distribution in different developing countries in recent decades. In addition, preparatory work is under way to develop a comparative study on the effects of macroeconomic stabilization policies on long-term growth."
1985,"The other new starts in the research program during fiscal year 1985 also reflect the new research priorities established by the RPC. Thus, in the area of costs and benefits of government interventions, one research project will examine the social welfare costs of capital-market regulations in Brazil; another will study the effects of regulations of product quality in international and domestic trade as applied in a number of developing countries; a third will examine the effectiveness of state intervention in Japan and"
1985,"the Republic of Korea in promoting the traded-goods sector in order to derive the policy implications for other developing countries; another study will analyze the distribution effects of government policies in Egypt. At a more macro level, work is under way to explore the effects of fiscal deficits in developing countries as compared with those in industrialized countries."
1985,"As in previous years, Bank staff participated in a number of UN meetings. These included the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), the Administrative Committee on Coordination (ACC), the World Health Organization (WHO) General Assembly, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Contracting Parties, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Trade and Development Board, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UN-IDO) Special Conference, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Governing Council, the governing board of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the Conference on the Emergency Situation in Africa, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) donors' meeting on the rehabilitation of agriculture in Africa. Bank staff also attended ministerial and other meetings of the UN Regional Economic Commission for Africa (ECA). The Bank has also maintained close contacts with the management and staff of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)."
1985,"Sector cooperation is also a growing feature between the Bank and other UN agencies. The Bank continued to maintain contacts with the International Trade Centre (ITC) at the operational level. The main areas of cooperation with the ITC are export development, export promotion, institution building, and training. A particular area of cooperation with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) is labor-based construction and maintenance as applied in the ILO Special Public Works Program (SPWP). A joint ILO/ UNDP/Bank workshop was organized at the Bank in February 1985 for an exchange of ideas and experience in this area. Cooperation under this program aims at implementing effective methods of construction for capital-scarce economies that are labor abundant. Concrete collaboration is ongoing in several countries (Ghana, Guatemala, Kenya, and Nepal). Wider contacts with the ILO were maintained through staff visits to discuss policy issues of mutual interest."
1985,"Governmental and nongovernmental groups. The Bank continued to take a keen interest in the ongoing policy dialogue on development issues in external fora. Bank staff addressed the issues of debt, trade, and the resumption of sustained growth in developing countries at the third session of the North-South round table held in Vienna, Austria, in September 1984. Bank staff will chair a panel on special assistance needs for sub-Saharan Africa at the eighteenth World Conference of the Society for International Development (SID) to be held in Rome, Italy, in mid 1985.

1985,"The period since 1980 has been characterized also by a number of adverse events emanating from the world economy and from climatic disturbances. First, the combined index of export prices (1978-80 = 100) for Eastern and Southern African countries declined from 116 in 1980 to 81 in 1982. Subsequent world recovery provided considerable relief to many developing countries, but generated only limited and delayed benefits for countries in this region. All countries in the region have benefited from the lower world oil prices of recent years, and in calendar year 1984, exporters of tea and coffee benefited from somewhat higher world prices for those commodities. In 1984, however, export prices of sugar, bananas, and copper all declined. As of the end of 1984, the regional export-price index stood at 82 (that is, at just about the 1983 level), and little improvement in the terms of trade is expected this year or next."
1985,"Mauritius experienced rapid growth until 1980, when it faced a serious economic crisis resulting from the collapse of sugar prices and the effects of two oil-price increases. Increased petroleum prices led to such a reduction in fuel imports that the cost of fuel imports was sharply reduced; the country's important tourist industry was also adversely affected. The government's initial response to these events was to sustain employment through an expansionary fiscal policy; it did not prove to be workable, however. The government then agreed to adopt new policy and institutional measures in the context of a series of five structural-adjustment loans. Despite continuing exogenous shocks (cyclones and declining terms of trade, for instance), Mauritius has succeeded not only in reducing sharply its financial disequilibria, but also in securing a base for diversification in its production and exports."
1985,"Unlike Mauritius, Somalia recorded low rates of growth in production throughout the 1970s, despite a sharp rise during the decade in the rate of investment. In 1979, a financial crisis emerged when, almost simultaneously, spending increased during the border conflict with Ethiopia, refugees from that conflict had to be accommodated, Soviet aid was withdrawn, and oil prices increased. The emergence of this crisis also reflected low returns to the stepped-up capital accumulation of the 1970s and the consequences of a rapid expansion in public employment and inefficient parastatal enterprises that were engaged in production and trade."
1985,"ernment announced major reforms of the exchange and trade regime: The official rate was devalued substantially and all private-sector foreign-exchange transactions began to take place at a market-determined rate; trade restrictions and price controls were virtually abolished. In mid January of 1985, a special meeting of donors, chaired by the World Bank, succeeded in mobilizing the additional external aid needed to close Somalia's projected balance-of-payments gap for 1985. The 1985 IMF standby was thus able to come into effect. A notable development at this special meeting was the reprogramming of a substantial volume of project aid into commodity aid. Effective execution of Somalia's important liberalization program will be difficult, but, if successful, the effects would be far reaching."
1985,"The main areas of focus of Ghana's policy reforms include further progress towards a realistic exchange rate, additional liberalization in the trade and import regime, and a restructuring of the budget with a view to raising the level of resource mobilization. During the past year, salaries of civil servants were improved, and funds were increased for investments in, and maintenance and rehabilitation of, the country's economic and social infrastructure. Reform of public corporations was begun, as was the gradual"
1985,"In Benin, growth in 1984 was negligible, and the prospects for 1985 are somber. Although the production of petroleum increased and cotton output rose markedly, these gains were offset by the effects of reduced reexport trade and lower investment activity. The country's financial situation worsened as government revenues declined by 13 percent, the result of a fall in import trade. Sectoral-policy dialogue with the Bank (particularly on agricultural policy) has been fruitful, however: Producer-price increases have resulted in increased cotton production, and policy reforms in the public-enterprise sector are now under consideration. In addition, discussions have begun with the IMF on financial stabilization."
1985,"In general, the economies of the East Asia and Pacific region continued their recovery from the deep international recession of the early 1980s, and, with the exception of the Philippines, economic growth in the region during 1984 exceeded 5 percent. The factors underlying economic recovery differed among countries, however. Economies heavily dependent on international trade—the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand, for example—benefited from continued growth in the industrialized world and the revival of trade, especially in manufactured goods. China continued its buoyant performance largely because of the favorable effects of its far-reaching policy reforms; the Lao People's Democratic Republic saw its economy, dependent on its agricultural sector, grow rapidly as a result of good weather; and Papua New Guinea and the small Pacific island nations experienced some recovery in their external demand."
1985,"At the same time, most countries made significant progress in reducing the substantial balance-of-payments and fiscal deficits of the early 1980s, a period characterized by international recession and a deterioration in terms of trade."
1985,"The Philippines continued to be in a severe economic and financial crisis. The deceleration in the growth of gross national product (GNP) since the beginning of the decade turned into a sharp decline in 1984, when GNP fell by about 6 percent. This decline was caused by several factors, including excessive reliance on foreign borrowing with short-term maturities, adverse movements in the external terms of trade, and high interest rates, as well as a severe drought."
1985,"its terms-of-trade index, which declined by about 4 percent after increasing by 7 percent in 1983. Concerned about the continued external imbalance, the government devalued the baht in November 1984 and delinked the currency from the US dollar by establishing a ""managed float"" that takes into account the currencies of Thailand's major trading partners."
1985,An Economy Dependent on World Trade
1985,"Burma's record of GDP growth has been good in recent years. The average rate of growth of about 6 percent during the period 1981-83 was slightly above the level in the preceding two-year period. Growth has been largely based upon improved agricultural performance (primarily paddy) which, in turn, has benefited from the systematic application of new seed varieties, fertilizers, and pesticides. Until fiscal 1982, balance-of-payments and domestic financial performance were also reasonably satisfactory. Since then, however, domestic and external imbalances have emerged. Externally, there has been some deterioration in the balance of payments, as the world market price for rice, the country's principal export, dropped sharply in fiscal 1983. Lowered rice prices, in turn, led to a sharp decline in the terms of trade and caused the ratio of Burma's external current-account deficit to rise five percentage points to 9 percent of GDP. This increase in the deficit was accompanied by a swing in the balance of payments, from a surplus of $60 million in 1981 to a deficit of $150 million (3 percent of GDP) in 1983. At the same time, Burma's overall public-sector budget"
1985,"In recent years, Pakistan has experienced rapid economic growth. Real GDP since the early 1980s has grown at an average 6.6 percent yearly, with agriculture and manufacturing increasing by 4 percent and 10 percent, respectively. Other indicators of economic performance have also shown steady improvement. Government initiatives to strengthen macroeco-nomic management and the management of agriculture, industry, and energy have been instrumental in Pakistan's improved performance. Growth has taken place despite a number of adverse factors, notably a marked decline in the country's external terms of trade following the 1979 oil-price increase, a declining trend, since the mid 1970s, in real net official assistance, and the unforeseen events that have occurred in Afghanistan, with its attendant requirements for increased expenditures for defense and refugee assistance."
1985,"Although the pattern and pace of adjustment have varied among countries, much progress was made in the past year in redesigning economic strategies and reducing economywide imbalances. With few exceptions, most countries have begun tackling fiscal imbalances; they have done so, in part, by reducing the growth of consumption, but, more particularly, by reducing public-investment programs. Several countries either have redesigned or are beginning to redesign their public-investment programs to ensure that scarce investible funds go to sectors and projects that command the highest priority. Efforts have been made to reduce both public-enterprise and consumer subsidies. As a result, the high fiscal deficits of the late 1970s have been greatly reduced. Nonetheless, modest deteriorations in the fiscal deficits of several countries of the region occurred in 1984—except in Egypt, where the deterioration was large. These deteriorations were caused largely by revenue shortfalls, as governments tried to reduce tax distortions in their economies, and especially, as measures to liberalize trade proceeded. Plans to raise taxes have already been announced in several countries where deficits threaten the adjustment effort. It should be noted, however, that fiscal retrenchment has exacted severe costs on many economies: Growth has been substantially reduced and unemployment has increased, and further compression of investment in economies whose adjustment has been the most profound could endanger the prospects for sustainable long-term growth."
1985,"The combination of the recovery in the United States and the modest resumption of growth in other industrialized countries, accompanied by ongoing efforts in the countries of the region to reform their trade regimes, led to a substantial export recovery in 1984 (the oil-exporting countries excluded). Virtually every oil-importing country registered a strong increase in merchandise exports, although those that rely heavily on workers' remittances—in particular, the Yemen Arab Republic and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen—showed marginal or lesser growth in total exports. More remarkably, import growth in 1984 was considerably below that of exports, and, in every country but Morocco, import growth declined from levels of the immediate preceding years. Strong efforts to control public-investment programs and, in certain countries, successful devaluations, were the major causes of import declines."
1985,"Progress in reducing current-account deficits in the balance of payments was more mixed. Several countries—notably, Cyprus, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia, and Turkey—experienced worsened deficits in 1984. The principal reasons for increased deficits were the introduction of import-liberalization measures, higher interest payments on debt, reduced flows of worker remittances (in some countries), and the impact of petroleum-price declines and volume quotas (in the oil-exporting countries). These deteriorations occurred—for the oil importers—in spite of higher export volumes, low import growth, and, for some, improved terms of trade. The import restraint that most countries experienced, in fact, can be attributed not only to continuing investment restraint, but also, to the financial constraints imposed by the need to service external debt. On the other hand, Algeria, Hungary, Portugal, Yemen Arab Republic, and Yugoslavia all improved their current-account positions. For all but Portugal, stringent domestic-demand measures, particularly on investment, were largely responsible for the improvement (in the case of the Yemen Arab Republic, restrictions on imports also played a part); in Portugal, stronger export growth (following a real devaluation in 1983), drawdowns in inventories, and a real decline in private—though not public—consumption and investment caused the improvement. In surveying these developments, the continuing import compression in many of the adjusting economies of the region remains a prominent feature of economic life; it is difficult to predict how much deeper, and indeed, for how much"
1985,"The Bank has been, and will continue to be, associated with efforts to promote structural change. Two of the region's borrowers, Turkey and Yugoslavia, have received structural-adjustment loans. A complementary instrument in support of reform has been sector loans. The Bank has made an industrial and trade-policy adjustment loan to Morocco, and, during the past year, committed funds for agricultural-sector loans to Turkey and Morocco. Lending for structural reform has been supported by a variety of economic and sector work; during fiscal 1985, the Bank conducted plan or public-sector investment reviews in Egypt, Hungary, and Turkey; a public-enterprise review in Morocco; and industrial-sector studies in Tunisia."
1985,"The Turkish economy has made significant advances in structural adjustment following the reform program initiated in 1980. That program, which has been supported by the Bank through five structural-adjustment loans, has relied on several instruments of economic management. These include: reforms of the trade and exchange-rate regimes, improvements in debt management, rationalization of the public-investment program, reform of state economic enterprises, and improvements in money and interest-rate management."
1985,"Hungary's GDP grew at 2.4 percent during 1984, a rate substantially higher than that of 1983 (0.7 percent). The most striking success of the Hungarian adjustment program (begun in 1980) has been the conversion of a convertible currency-account deficit in 1982 into a record trade surplus of $1.2 billion in 1984. While modest increases in exports have contributed to this improvement, imports and investment have both been drastically compressed. Since 1980, Hungary's imports have grown by only about 1 percent a year in real terms; gross domestic investment has declined for six consecutive years, and, by 1984, it had dropped to almost two thirds of its 1978 level. Together with the restoration of inflows of external capital, these elements of economic stabilization have permitted Hungary"
1985,"to rebuild its convertible-currency reserves and to reestablish its creditworthiness. However, a substantial price has been paid in terms of forgone growth and minimal improvements in consumption for the population. Hungary is proceeding with major, medium-term reforms linked to adjustments in incentives and economic structure; these include expanding the role of market prices, improving enterprise management, and upgrading industrial technology and agricultural efficiency. These adjustment efforts have, as a major goal, improvement in the country's export competitiveness. If these efforts are successful, and if there is no strong downturn in the external-trade and credit environments, Hungary's path to sustainable growth, one that is less constrained by foreign-exchange shortages, should be less difficult."
1985,"slowing the growth of domestic expenditure have been intensified since 1983. Stabilization policies introduced with the support of the IMF have included further adjustment of the exchange rate, tighter control of government spending, and a considerable scaling down of overextended public-investment plans. In addition, Morocco has now embarked on a program to restructure incentives through trade liberalization and export promotion, and is beginning to tackle the financial and administrative problems of the economy's large public sector."
1985,"The impact of the policies adopted since 1983 has been encouraging. Export performance has improved significantly, and earnings from tourism and flows of workers' remittances have increased. Imports declined sharply in 1983 as a result of cutbacks in public investment. In 1984, however, imports rebounded, partly as a result of trade liberalization, but also because cereals and fuels had to be imported to counteract the effects of a protracted drought. Morocco's current-account deficit of the balance of payments, which increased to 10.7 percent of GDP in 1984 (from 8.0 percent in 1983), is expected to decline in 1985. The stabilization policies adopted in 1983 have also led to a reduction in the government budget deficit. The combined impact of stabilization policies and poor harvests depressed GDP growth in both 1983 and 1984 (2.2 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively), but a recovery is expected in 1985."
1985,"Continued good economic management ensured that the reduced growth of domestic production and the substantial decline in the inflow of foreign exchange were absorbed without endangering the country's economic stability. Imports declined in line with the sizable reduction in public and private investment and as a result of successful government efforts to reduce the recurrent budget deficit through cuts in subsidies and improved collection of direct and indirect taxes. The decline in imports, combined with a modest increase in exports, contributed to an improvement in the balance of trade. The sharp reduction in official transfers more than offset the decline in imports, however, and resulted in a further deterioration of Jordan's current-account deficit."
1985,"main export, oil, and from considerable financial assistance from oil-exporting, capital-surplus countries. Syria has also profited from the opportunities for employment, trade, and construction in oil-exporting, capital-surplus countries."
1985,"Since 1980, however, Syria's net oil surplus has all but disappeared, and financial assistance from, and opportunities for employment in, neighboring countries have declined. As in other countries that have dwindling oil surpluses and that face difficult economic circumstances, Syria needs to take steps to deal with its fiscal deficit and to put together a package of structural reforms that can lead to sustainable growth in the medium term. Reductions in consumer subsidies, reforms in public-enterprise finance, enhanced use of the instruments of trade policy, and revitalization of agricultural growth must be included as major objectives in any program of structural reform."
1985,"Led by increases in agricultural production and manufacturing output, Tunisia's GDP grew by 5.5 percent in 1984. Growth was achieved, however, at the cost of a worsened current-account deficit in the balance of payments. While exports in real terms increased marginally faster than imports (which were restricted by tight controls), the worsening terms of trade widened the current-account deficit in nominal terms to 8.8 percent of GDP."
1985,"Tunisia's burden of external debt, while still relatively small, has been growing; in addition, the net foreign-exchange surplus of the oil sector is likely to decline through the rest of the decade. Key policy issues (energy pricing and conservation, consumer subsidies, public-sector management, and trade policy) are being tackled in an effort to structure the economy so that it can deal effectively with the longer-term issues of growth and employment."
1985,"During the past year, some Latin American countries emerged from the deep recession that overtook the region in 1981, and for the region as a whole, output rose for the first time since 1981. An important contributing factor to this resumption of economic growth was a substantial expansion of exports, which made possible a simultaneous increase in imports, a further strengthening of the region's trade surplus, and an accumulation of international reserves.7"
1985,"barely matched the increase in population. The increase in the level of economic activity was insufficient to keep pace with the expansion of the region's labor force, and open unemployment rose. In over two thirds of the countries in the region, per capita output declined. Adjusted for the deterioration in the region's external terms of trade that took place during the past year, per capita gross national income declined further to the level of the early 1970s. The terms of trade of Latin American and Caribbean countries have now deteriorated 22 percent since 1980."
1985,The strengthening of the region's external position has been brought about by a turnaround in the aggregate trade balance (from a deficit of 1.5 percent of GDP in 1981 to a surplus of about 5 percent in 1984); this turnaround was achieved by limiting the growth of imports in 1984 to 4.4 percent and by expanding exports by 9.3 percent. Imports remained much lower than before the crisis in real terms.
1985,"Virtually all of the trade surplus generated was absorbed by net payments of interest on outstanding external debt. As a consequence of the increase in the trade surplus, the deficit in the region's current-account balance was reduced to $3.0 billion, the lowest level, relative to GDP, of the postwar period. For the first time in four years, net capital inflows to Latin America increased (from $4.4 billion in 1983 to $10.6 billion in 1984) and exceeded the region's current-account deficit. As a consequence, holdings of international reserves in Latin America rose by $7.5 billion."
1985,"Brazil, whose weight in the region's aggregate statistics is considerable, increased its export earnings by 23 percent, expanded its trade surplus by $6.0 billion, and virtually eliminated the deficit in the current account of its balance of payments. As a consequence, Brazil simultaneously increased its international reserves and resumed its economic growth, albeit at a greatly reduced rate (4.5 percent) from that achieved in the 1970s."
1985,"A second and equally important factor essential to recovery is strong economic management in the debtor countries themselves. Given the severe resource constraints that these countries face, every effort must be made to reduce fiscal deficits further and to mobilize additional domestic resources for investment. Even in the best of circumstances, however, the resources available for investment purposes will be more limited than in the period preceding the current economic crisis. Most countries realize that every effort must be made to ensure that all available resources are used efficiently. The current lull in investment provides an opportunity for countries to strengthen mechanisms for screening public investments so that only those of the highest priority are undertaken. Considerable benefit can also be derived from improvements in the efficiency of public-sector agencies and an expansion of their internal generation of resources for investment. Establishment of a system in which appropriate market incentives are permitted to operate can help ensure that private investment is channeled to activities in which there is a relative comparative advantage. Elimination of factor-price distortions can also enhance the efficiency of resource allocation and, in the current circumstances, accelerate the absorption of unemployed labor. Of special importance is the removal of biases against exports in the trade regime so as to permit accelerated economic growth, improved creditworthiness, and efficient creation of employment opportunities. In some cases, the removal of such biases would cause an increase in public and private investment in rural areas."
1985,"Because economic activity in Central America continued to be affected by political and military tensions, differences occurred in economic performance among the countries. Although all countries had positive rates of real GDP growth during 1984, only in Costa Rica was the increase sufficient to bring about a per capita improvement. In each of the seven countries, the level of economic activity remained considerably below the 1980 level, the consequence, in part, of regional tensions that reduced intraregional trade and investment."
1985,"In contrast with some of the largest countries in Latin America, the external position of most Central American countries continued to deteriorate, as imports increased more rapidly than exports. Despite some terms-of-trade improvement, which occurred as a result of higher prices for exports of coffee and cotton and lower prices for imported petroleum, merchandise-trade deficits widened. Unsettled conditions added to the balance-of-payment difficulties by encouraging capital flight, inhibiting voluntary lending by commercial banks, and by reducing direct foreign investment. To ameliorate these difficulties. Central American countries sought to increase capital flows from both official creditors and commercial banks and attempted to restructure their external debt. Balance-of-payments assistance provided by the United States to several countries increased significantly in 1984. Nevertheless, the countries of Central America generally faced increased pressure on their foreign-exchange resources as evidenced by the expanded role of parallel markets, the wider divergence between official and parallel market rates, and the persistence of arrears in foreign payments."
1985,"In 1984, most Caribbean economies began to recover from the 1981-83 recession. Spearheading their recovery was a 5 percent rise in tourist arrivals. By contrast, the manufacturing sector showed little growth, in part because of the collapse of the Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM) following the adoption of additional trade restrictions among its members in 1983. The extent of the economic recovery varied widely among Caribbean countries. In"
1985,"During the past year, the Bank approved a $300 million loan to Colombia in support of the first phase of the government's trade-adjustment program. The immediate objective of the program is to support export promotion. Measures to stimulate exports focus on the reduction of discretionary elements that restrict access to duty-free intermediate goods by exporters; on the elimination of most export restrictions; on the gradual replacement of import quotas by tariffs; and on improvement in the tariff structure. The loan is to be disbursed in two tranches and is subject to close monitoring by the Bank. The loan has been instrumental in convincing commercial banks to increase their exposure in Colombia in support of specific export projects."
1985,"EQUATORIAL GUINEA: IDA—$9.3 million. Agricultural credit will be made available and technical assistance provided for institution building so as to help the government restore cocoa production and exports to their past levels, thus generating foreign exchange and redressing a marked negative trade balance. Cofinancing is anticipated from BADEA ($2.8 million), the OPEC Special Fund ($1 million), and the EEC ($900,000). Total cost: $16.2 million."
1985,"SUDAN: IDA—$5.5 million. By renewal and extension of water supplies and veterinary services along livestock trade routes, the continued flow of marketed livestock from the project areas of western Sudan to the principal towns and for export will be enhanced. Cofinancing ($6 million) is being provided by IFAD. Total cost: $19.6 million."
1985,"COLOMBIA: IBRD—$300 million. The immediate objective of this loan is to support the first phase of the government's program of trade-policy reforms, designed to revitalize the external sector and to reorient the economy towards the production of tradables. The loan will also have a broader impact through its endorsement of the government's economic program for effecting a significant adjustment of the economy, while, at the same time, sustaining growth and employment generation. The financing provided lends vitally needed support for putting together the overall financial package and for ensuring the enhanced participation of commercial banks needed to complete the adjustment process. General imports of industrial and agricultural inputs and raw materials for export firms will be financed, as will several studies related to export incentives, export promotion, external-debt management, and budget programming and planning."
1985,"JORDAN: IBRD—$30 million. Transport bottlenecks and congestion on Jordan's international trade routes will be relieved by a multimode transport project with both highway and railway components. Technical assistance will be provided for highways, railways, and the Ports Corporation. Cofinancing is being provided by the SFD ($ 11.4 million) and the IsDB ($9.3 million). Total cost: $132.8 million."
1985,"While the Regional Office plans to strengthen existing consultative groups through cooperation with the UNDP, the African Development Bank (AfDB), the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), a determined effort is also being made to expand the geographical coverage of consultative groups; consultative groups are planned for Mauritania and Guinea and will be established once a number of measures, including the preparation of investment programs, have been completed by the governments concerned. Donor meetings chaired by the Bank to organize financing for development-related imports were also held for Guinea-Bissau and Mauritania during the past fiscal year."
1981,"1980, as production declined somewhat, prices rose and world stocks of cereals were drawn down. The below-trend production levels largely resulted from reduced outputs in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere, mainly in the U.S. and China; the developing countries did better, with the countries of South Asia, in particular, producing record crops in 1980/81. Prices began to ease in the early months of 1981 as a result of good crop forecasts in major producing regions, lower livestock production, and higher interest rates."
1981,"ceased to grow. In fact, excluding the first loan to China, the total lending program to the region for fiscal 1981 actually declined marginally from the amount lent in fiscal 1980."
1981,China and the Bank: the First Year
1981,"On May 15, 1980, the Executive Directors of the World Bank decided that the government of the People's Republic of China would represent China in the Bank and in IDA. The Chinese government and the Bank adopted for the first year of the relationship a program having two aspects. First, heavy emphasis was placed on economic and sector work, in an attempt to understand the principal factors that have determined the social and economic development of China during the last decades. Some of these factors are discussed briefly in this chapter. Second, preparation of a small group of high-priority projects was started immediately, and an appraisal of a university development project, approved by the Executive Directors in June, and preappraisal work on two other projects— agriculture and ports—were completed."
1981,"China has a varied climate and terrain, large energy resources, a largely self-sufficient and diversified production base, and a highly literate, disciplined population. During the past three decades, most of its development efforts have had two objectives: industrialization, with an emphasis on heavy industry, and elimination of the worst aspects of poverty. Chinese development strategy has been constrained by an extreme shortage of cultivable land and a high degree of international isolation."
1981,"Efforts directed toward alleviation of poverty began with an initial phase of land redistribution, followed by agricultural programs and widespread provision of social services, for the most part using local resources and initiatives. Despite slow growth of agricultural production in relation to population, the effects on human welfare have been impressive. At the same time, a massive infusion of centrally mobilized capital led to rapid industrialization, using technology most of which dated from the 1950s. Growth of gross national product (GNP) per capita was well above the average for low-income countries— 2.7 percent a year from 1957 to 1979. Consumption has grown significantly, although more slowly than total output, owing to the emphasis given to investment growth. Nevertheless, China's most remarkable achievement has been to meet far more of the basic needs of low-income groups than have been met of their counterparts in most other poor countries. During the past decade, the country has also been quite successful in reducing its population growth."
1981,"The Bank's introductory analysis of China's economy, covering China's past development"
1981,"—The number of agricultural research scientists in the developing countries is grossly inadequate; their number—about 23,000, excluding those in China—corresponds roughly to the total number in Japan alone."
1981,"Technical assistance has long been an integral part of World Bank operations, and the volume, scope, and diversity of mechanisms used by the Bank in providing it to member governments continued to expand in fiscal 1981. The primary way of providing technical assistance continued to be in loans made for specific sectors and in components of loans made for other capital purposes. In fiscal 1981, the amount of this technical assistance, including funds provided for supervision, implementation, and engineering services, totaled $979 million, compared to $807 million allocated for this purpose in fiscal 1980. Loans extended for technical assistance in specific sectors totaled $50 million in energy, $33 million in power, $14 million in transportation, $17.7 in water supply and sewerage, and $14.7 in industry. Among the large technical assistance components were $30 million approved in the China University Development loan and credit of $200 million, $40.1 million of a $359 million loan to Colombia for hydroelectric power, $26.3 million of a $60 million loan to Brazil for agricultural research, and $12.8 million of an $85 million loan to Bangladesh for a gas development project. In addition, the Bank extended thirteen free-standing technical assistance loans and credits for a total of $131.1 million. These went to Bangladesh, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Egypt, Guyana, Madagascar, Malawi, Nigeria, Senegal, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zaire. By comparison, in fiscal 1980, four such loans and credits totaling $13 million, were made."
1981,"The new projects include a $3.4 million project to assist sixty participating countries in assessing their needs for assistance in their energy sectors, the first project of the Bank and the UNDP in the People's Republic of China— an ""umbrella"" project for the preparation of investment projects—and a technical-assistance project in Bolivia, set up specifically to help the government carry out the program for which the Bank has made a structural-adjustment loan. Near the end of the year, the Bank also signed, with the UNDP and the government of Pakistan, a project document for design work on the Kalabah Dam. This project, for which the UNDP will contribute $8 million, will be the largest single UNDP-funded project for which the Bank has served as executing agency."
1981,"There was general recognition by the Executive Directors that the external financial requirements of the developing countries during the fiscal years 1981-85 had changed since the formulation of the ""Future Role of the Bank"" paper in 1977, because of such factors as higher-than-expected rates of inflation, the substantial increase in the rates of return on domestic production of energy in the oil-importing developing countries, the addition of structural-adjustment lending, and the representation of China by the People's Republic of China. In view of the complexity and importance of the subject matter, they considered early in the fiscal year a report from the President on energy in the developing countries; they agreed that the developing countries required additional technical and financial assistance for energy investments, and they endorsed the proposal to study the feasibility of providing additional financing for energy development in the developing countries through an energy affiliate. It was also agreed that the report would be published in a suitable form. Separately, they approved arrangements with the United Nations Development Programme for the financing of energy-sector assessments in developing countries."
1981,"Following their decision that the government of the People's Republic of China represents China in the Bank and its affiliates, the Executive Directors approved a supplement to the fiscal 1981 administrative expense budget to support the work program for China and a draft report and resolution to the Governors, who voted affirmatively to increase China's subscription to the Bank's capital."
1981,"CHINA: Bank—$100 million; IDA—$100 million. The initial phase of a program to strengthen higher education and research activities in science and engineering will be supported by this first Bank operation in the country. Civil works, furniture, equipment, the services of specialists, and fellowships will be financed to help increase the number of graduates and the volume of research work at twenty-six leading universities; improve the quality of graduates and research work; and strengthen management at universities and in the Ministry of Education. Total cost: $295 million."

1981,"The EDI and the Association of Development Financing Institutions in Asia and the Pacific (ADFIAP) offered a seminar in Washington for the training of directors of development banking institutions. Another seminar on training methodologies, in Spanish, was also held. One course in Spanish, on rural development projects, and two courses in French, one on national economic management, the other on education programs and projects, were held. Fiscal 1981 marked the beginning of participation by the EDI in the training of Chinese officials with a seminar on project planning for senior officials held in Washington, followed by a course on general project planning in Shanghai."
1981,"The economic shocks of the 1970s discussed in last year's Annual Report continued to reverberate in the world economy during the past year. Recession in the industrial countries,' continuing high energy costs, inflation, high interest rates, volatile exchange rates, low growth of world trade, and declining prices of primary products other than petroleum, led to difficulties for many developing countries. The principal problems were thus similar to those of the 1970s, but there were some crucial differences. The current downturn came after years of relatively slow growth, mounting unemployment, and high inflation in the industrial countries. It was much milder than the sharp recession of 1974-75, but recovery is expected to be slower because of the difficulties of reducing inflation, now considered a major underlying cause of the weakness of many economies. There is thus not much cause for optimism in the global outlook for the near term."
1981,"The resilience shown by many developing countries in the face of so unfavorable an international environment was all the more remarkable. Developing country growth was 4.6 percent in 1980, once again substantially higher than the 1.3 percent growth of the industrial countries (Table 1). Many developing countries increased both their penetration of industrial country markets and their trade with each other. They were thus able to continue to borrow from the"
1981,"To judge from the experience of the first few months of 1981, it appears that slow growth will continue in the industrial countries through the year. Government fiscal and monetary policies remain restrictive because of widespread concern over inflation and trade deficits. Rates of inflation seem to be declining, partly helped by the easing of real prices of oil and other primary-products. In some countries, inflationary pressures are already lessening partly because of the willingness of employees in some countries to accept a reduction in real wages."
1981,"their terms of trade. In the last two years, the oil-importing developing countries increased their foreign borrowings (with a greater reliance on short-term borrowing and reserve-related credit, primarily financing from the International Monetary Fund (IMF)), and many drew down, or at least stopped accumulating, international reserves. At the same time, the growth rate in the volume of their imports increased. Interest payments on their larger external debt also rose."
1981,"will be further damage to the developing countries and to the developed countries in the longer run; not only will their exports be hurt, but also the pattern of trade and the sectoral distribution of investment in both developed and developing countries will be distorted."
1981,"During the past two years, the disturbances in the international economy—large increases in the price of oil, high rates of inflation, and sluggish growth in the industrial countries and in world trade—have been reflected in a widening of global surpluses and deficits in the balance of payments. The wave of oil price increases in 1979 and 1980 produced a sizable gain in the terms of trade for the oil-exporting countries. The consequent surplus of the six capital-surplus oil-exporting countries6 on current account, excluding official transfers, is estimated to have been more than $100,000 million in 1980. By contrast, in 1978, they had a surplus of only $19,000 million. The other oil-exporting countries7 were able to eliminate a deficit of almost an equal amount (Table 3)."
1981,World Trade
1981,"In dollar terms, world merchandise trade increased by nearly 30 percent in 1980. In volume, the increase was less than 4 percent. The reduced growth in volume in 1980 was primarily a result of a decline in the amount of petroleum traded, although the growth of trade in manufactures also slowed."
1981,"The share of fuel in the total value of merchandise trade rose from 17 percent in 1978 and 20 percent in 1979 to almost 25 percent in 1980; in contrast, its share in the total volume dropped from 17 percent in 1978 and 1979 to 16 percent in"
1981,"The delegates broadly agreed on negotiations to cover trade, energy, raw materials, development finance, and monetary issues. Questions of procedure and agenda have not, however, been fully resolved, particularly on the appropriate relationship between the proposed central negotiating body and the specialized agencies."
1981,"South-South Cooperation. The events of the past year have given impetus to efforts at cooperation among the developing countries. Despite ideological differences, differing country-specific needs, and the geographic isolation of countries from one another, South-South cooperation has become an important objective of the developing countries. Following earlier meetings in Geneva and Vienna of developing countries represented by the Group of 77 (G-77), the Foreign Ministers of the G-77 met at Caracas, Venezuela, in May 1981 to consider measures to further the framework of economic cooperation among developing countries in the areas of trade, technology, food and agriculture, energy, raw materials, finance, and industrialization. Agreement was reached on the need to"
1981,"increase efforts for a Generalized System of Preferences for trade among developing countries. It was also agreed to establish a mechanism for the coordination, implementation, and monitoring of programs for economic cooperation. For this purpose, a small technical group would be established through special arrangements with governments of developing countries."
1981,"The review of economic development in Eastern Africa during the 1970s in last year's Annual Report painted a grim picture. A combination of a setback in the trend of farm output, deterioration in the terms of trade, and institutional weaknesses added up to a formidable array of constraints. In this Annual Report, the main focus is on the region's severe shortage of imports, the consequences on production and investment caused by the shortage, and the measures governments and the Bank are taking to secure recovery."
1981,"In some countries constrained imports were undermining exports, as mentioned earlier. In many more countries, the rationing of imports reduced supplies for agricultural and industrial enterprises, including public firms, that cater to the domestic market. The reduction in imports of intermediate goods sharply reduced the use made of existing production capacity and increased unemployment in the modern sector. Even general government services such as agricultural extension, schools, and health facilities were deprived of critical imported items in many countries. Recurrent budgetary allocations to many agencies for maintenance and operations were cut as government tax revenues, heavily dependent on foreign trade, failed to keep pace with requirements."
1981,"Faced with the imperative of rehabilitating their economies, the vast majority of Western African countries are likely to take the critical internal policy measures needed, and the Bank is prepared to assist them. As mentioned earlier, the Bank has provided support to the structural-adjustment program in Senegal; discussions are under way with a few other countries in the region with a view to devising reform programs at both the macroeconomic and sectoral levels. It would be unrealistic to expect, however, that with the present level of external assistance domestic adjustment alone will accelerate the pace of growth throughout the region. In the long term, inflows of public and private capital at higher levels and a more favorable trade environment are also essential ingredients."
1981,"With their rapidly growing and generally open economies, the countries in the region that borrow most heavily from the Bank have been deeply affected by recent events in the international economy, which are discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report. The changes were adverse for the three large petroleum-importing countries: Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand. The approximate doubling of nominal petroleum prices between mid 1979 and mid 1980 cost these countries some 4-6 percent of their real incomes. In contrast to the situation in 1974-75 these losses were not compensated for by increased prices of other commodities exported by countries in the region: although prices of sugar and grains increased, those of some metals and vegetable oils declined. The net effect on the balance of payments was positive for Thailand and mixed for the Philippines. The effect of the loss in the terms of trade for the three large petroleum importers came on top of already"
1981,"The deteriorating climate of world trade has, however, made it difficult to effect the adjustment by increasing exports. In the case of Korea, a major exporting country, the efforts to diversify to a technologically more advanced mix of output and exports—such as automobiles and heavy machinery—proved to be more difficult than had been anticipated. These difficulties were exacerbated by the inflationary pressures brought on by the high rates of growth in gross domestic product (GDP), which averaged 11 percent a year during 1976-78, and rapidly rising labor costs, which were caused by the tightening labor market. The declining competitiveness in exports necessitated a 36 percent devaluation of the won in 1980, which, while improving the balance of trade, brought on another inflation-"
1981,"not be easy. Two countries, Korea and Thailand, have been successful in this respect since the 1960s. But the situation may be changing for the worse, for Korea may find new trade restraints in the path of its export-led strategy, Thailand can no longer count on the availability of additional land reserves, and both countries are wrestling with scarcity of budgetary resources."
1981,"Although at varying rates of intensity, all countries are attempting to address these problems, and the Bank is assisting them in their efforts. The three countries with the largest current-account deficits—Korea, Thailand, and the Philippines—especially are moving across a broad front to induce structural adjustments in their economies. Areas of special importance are appropriate pricing policies and trade policies, mobilization of resources, monetary policy, conservation of energy, import substitution, industrial and financial reorganization, rural development, alleviation of poverty, management of foreign debt, and improved public administration. Within the space of the Annual"
1981,"In the specific case of the Philippines, the Bank's structural-adjustment lending in fiscal 1981 is based on a comprehensive set of industrial and trade policy reforms being implemented by the government. In that country the Bank has also followed a new approach to the financing of industrial development by channeling its lend-"
1981,"problem as the current-account deficit increased sharply. Imports rose more than 3 percent, fueled primarily by sharp increases in the volume and prices of imported petroleum and fertilizer. This situation was exacerbated by a fall in domestic production of crude oil owing to political agitation in Assam. Although export performance improved somewhat, growth was insufficient to counter the deterioration in the terms of trade."
1981,"The resurgence in the Sri Lankan economy and the accompanying pressures on resources had, by early 1981, reached the stage at which major stocktaking and policy actions were essential in order to preserve the gains reached in the period since 1977. The central problem was excessive spending on long-gestation or low-yielding projects, coupled with stagnation in exports of tree crops. A reversal of the deterioration in the overall economic situation requires a reform of public finances, including better performance of corporations in the public sector, reevaluation of the public investment program, improvements in the tree-crop sector, and rectification of the trade deficit by stimulating exports and containing imports."
1981,"rates of growth in gross domestic product (GDP), consumption, and investment fell noticeably. Poor export performance and deteriorating terms of trade, together with a poor harvest and an earthquake in Montenegro, led to a significant increase in Yugoslavia's current-account deficit in 1979. The country's short-term response was to adopt a stringent stabilization program and a major devaluation. Despite a further deterioration in terms of trade and a sharp rise in interest costs, these actions significantly reduced imports, boosted exports, and lessened the current-account deficit. For the medium term, both Yugoslavia and Romania are taking steps to conserve energy and reduce dependence on imported oil; both countries are also stressing increased agricultural production as a way of promoting agricultural exports."
1981,"Another response to the current economic climate is the opening up and liberalization of trade in which several countries are now engaged. This process involves varying degrees of liberalization in the financial markets of these countries and, more generally, growing reliance on the market system to set prices and allocate resources. Such measures have already begun to show positive results. Higher energy prices are encouraging conservation and development of alternative fuels, whereas more remunerative prices to farmers are leading to greater and more diversified agricultural production, notably in the southern ""cone"" countries—Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay—of South America. The countries that have adopted a policy of positive real interest rates have increased domestic savings that are channeled through the financial system, have stemmed capital flight, and have encouraged inflows of private capital from abroad. In some cases, liberalization of trade is already being reflected in more efficient industrial production and expansion of nontradi-tional exports."
1981,"Progress toward liberalization of trade in Latin America is hampered, however, by the recession that has affected most of the industrial countries and by the threat of protectionist pressures in some of them. To some extent, the countries in the region are trying to compensate for these factors by intensifying efforts to expand exports to other developing countries, both outside and within the region. In order to remove some of the obstacles to the progress of"
1981,"intraregional trade, the eleven signatory countries of the Montevideo Trade Treaty of 1960 agreed, in 1980, on a new treaty and the replacement of the existing Latin American Free Trade Association (ALALC) by a new intergovernmental organization, the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI). The new entity will have more flexible rules, in keeping with the changing needs of the countries, and will rely on bilateral negotiations more than on broad, multilateral agreements."
1981,"The worth of the imports of the oil exporters rose by a third, well below export growth, leading to a doubling, to $1,700 million, of their trade surplus. The trade deficit of the countries that do not export oil rose from $2,300 million in 1979 to $7,700 million in 1980, an increase caused more by the higher cost of imports—24 percent—than by their increase in real terms, which was about 6 percent. Except for the oil exporters, the terms of trade of the region are estimated to have deteriorated by about 8 percent between 1979 and 1980."
1981,Members of the Bank staff seconded to the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) assisted in the drafting of the basic-documents on policies and procedures required for the operations of the Common Fund for Commodities. Bank staff also collaborated with
1981,"A current example of applications at the country level is a study of trade policies and incentive policies, to be undertaken as part of current work on structural-adjustment lending to Turkey. The Bank's research on the structure and consequences of trade protection in developing countries began in the late 1960s and has had a powerful influence in favor of more open trade policies and industrial policies in developing countries. This influence has been channeled in a variety of ways, including the assumption of advisory functions by researchers in member developing countries, changes in the content and rigor of analyses of trade incentives and policies, and discussion in public documents, notably the World Development Report. In some instances, the findings of case studies undertaken in Bank research projects have influenced trade policies and incentive policies directly; in others, regional offices of the Bank have mounted their own studies of the incentive framework to provide the basis for discussions with governments."
1981,"The Bank does not trade in the currencies of its member countries for its own account. Adjustments arising from translation of currencies to U.S. dollar equivalents do not bring realized gains or losses as would actual conversions into U.S. dollars. The General Reserve, therefore, rather than net income, is charged or credited annually with the amount of adjustment made necessary by currency depreciations or appreciations. In fiscal 1981 the result of that translation of currencies into U.S. dollar equivalents was a debit to the General Reserve of $582 million; in fiscal 1980 there had been a credit of $104 million.

Investments include securities purchased under agreements to resell amounting to $3,025,000 ($5,682,000—1980)."
1981,"To help fight mounting inflationary pressures at home, the larger industrial countries adopted more restrictive monetary policies. In addition, most industrial countries achieved some fiscal restraint. Unemployment in the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD),which has been rising secularly in recent years, is now-expected to exceed 25 million by late 1981, representing nearly 7.5 percent of the labor force."

Significant progress has been made in implementing structural reforms, but in the face of the country's deep-rooted economic difficulties, continued domestic efforts and sustained support from the international community will be necessary before Turkey can return to a path of economic growth with a sustainable balance-of-payments position."

In addition, such large borrowers as Indonesia and the Philippines have annual per capita incomes of under $1,000, and, despite rapid progress, continue to face difficult development problems. At the other end of the spectrum, the small Pacific island member states are struggling to attain higher growth rates and participate in the dynamic-economic expansion of the Pacific Rim, The primary challenge facing all these countries is, of course, reducing poverty. The economies in transition face particular problems in moving to a market-oriented system based on more private-sector activity. The region is still largely rural and will undergo rapid urbanization in the coming decades, adding to the already large backlog of demand for infrastructure. Moreover, the region’s growth has placed a heavy burden on its natural resources and environmental quality, which will require major remedial and preventive action."

1995,"The surging demand for infrastructure in the region is related both to its rapid rate of growth and its accelerating urbanization. Nearly all the countries in the region are experiencing bottlenecks, and investment demands for infrastructure have been estimated at SI.5 trillion between now and the end of the decade. The Bank is increasing its financing of vital infrastructure—transport, power, water, sanitation, and telecommunications—in East Asia, which rose to $2.7 billion in fiscal 1995. The share of Bank commitments in support of infrastructure investments is expected to continue its climb, but the demand is greater than public sources are likely to be able to meet, and more private financing must be encouraged. The Philippines has led the way by sponsoring more than thirty hot (build-operate-transler) investments in power supply, effectively using private financing to solve its most pressing infrastructure bottleneck.- China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand are also encouraging private financing of infrastructure, and other countries in the region are investigating the potential. The Bank has advised countries on the necessary regulatory and legal structure for promoting such investments while protecting public interests. Several billions of dollars of private equity funds have been raised for infrastructure investment in the region."

Within these overall figures, it is important to note major shifts in the allocation of resources. The mature borrowers, Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand, are net repayers, and their share ot new lending from the Bank is stable or declining. They do, however, continue to rely on the Bank for special studies and projects in innovative areas. Some countries, most recently Indonesia, have taken advantage of favorable reserve positions to prepay some of their Bank loans. These factors partially mask the large positive net transfers going to the low-income countries of the region. Net transfers to China, tor example, amounted to some $1.4 billion."

In addition, efforts continue to be made to enhance private sector competitiveness through measures aimed at internal liberalization—the abolition of monopolies, the promotion ot competition in domestic trade, and the rationalization of investment-incentive schemes.

Financial markets are being liberalized across the region, providing greater scope for private participation and market determination of interest rates and credit allocation.

Industrial and mining output increased by about 5 per cent; although this increase was less than in the preceding year and slightly below the average for the postwar decade, it was high in comparison with the interwar period. Farm output rose somewhat more slowly, but continued the upward trend of the last few years. On the other hand, worldwide inflationary tendencies continued and were accompanied by heavy investment demand which pressed with increasing force on the available supply of savings. This contributed to sharp rises in interest rates almost everywhere."
1956,"A remarkable upswing in world trade during the year brought total exports to more than $95,000 million, the highest level in history. This rise occurred in spite of the economic dislocation caused by the closing of the Suez Canal and by the interruption of normal pipeline supplies in the Middle East; the effects of these disturbances were less severe and less protracted than had been feared. Although prices of manufactured goods continued to rise, the increase of 12 per cent in the value of total exports was mainly the result of a larger volume of goods exported. There was a particularly rapid growth—in some cases by • more than a fifth—in the export earnings of industrialized countries. The growth in earnings of most of the less developed countries was considerably slower. In the aggregate their export volume increased moderately, but the export prices of their primary products advanced on the average only slightly, and some even declined."
1956,"There are, of course, some countries whose postwar growth record has been less favorable, with inflation continuing unchecked and indebtedness mounting to a level that will not be easy to service. There are also countries which have failed to increase the volume of their exports, and in which only rising export prices or emergency external assistance have made possible the financing of increased imports and other external expenditures. But in most countries the growth of production and exports, to which foreign investment has itself notably contributed, has kept pace with the increase in total public indebtedness. In general, it appears that postwar gains in production and trade have been sufficient not only to enable borrowing countries to continue to maintain service on their obligations but also to provide a foundation for further productive investment."

The results of the highway improvements financed under the first Bank loan and with Ethiopian Government funds are evident in the growth of road transport by some 50% and in the sharp reduction of transportation freight charges. This has been an important factor in the rapid expansion of Ethiopia's foreign trade, particularly in exports of coffee and oilseeds.

1956,"Access to the Port of Bangkok, on the Chao Phya River, was long impeded by a bar of silt at the river's mouth. Only ships of less than 4,000 deadweight tons could reach the harbor; larger vessels had to transfer cargoes to lighters some 50 miles away in the Gulf of Thailand. Part of a Bank loan of $4.4 million made in 1950 was used to deepen and widen the channel through the bar, and since 1954 ships up to 10,000 deadweight tons have been able to reach the port. The savings in lighterage fees and in the costs of handling cargo have been substantial—an important factor in the Thai economy, since nearly 90% of Thailand's foreign trade passes through the port. However, the rapid silting in the channel necessitates constant dredging; the present loan financed the purchase of three dredges and auxiliary equipment to replace worn-out or inadequate equipment previously in use, and will enable the Port Authority to maintain adequate depth of water in the channel and the harbor itself.

1957,"The Bank's operations were conducted in an economic climate considerably different from that of recent years. Industrial production in the United States, which had reached a peak in December 1956, remained almost stationary until September 1957. Then a rapid downturn set in. True, the impact of this decline was less serious for the outside world as a whole than it would have been if the total of United States imports had not been well maintained, as they were, according to available data, through 1957 and into the first quarter of 1958; but the downward movement in commodity prices, already evident in 1956, was intensified. As a consequence, the foreign exchange earnings of primary producing countries decreased, and their capacity to import was not assisted by any similar fall in the prices of the manufactured goods which they need to buy abroad. This worsening in the terms of trade of the less developed countries, added to some slowing down in the rate of private capital inflow, resulted in increased pressure on their balance of payments and led in some cases to a fall in gold and foreign exchange reserves."
1957,"The Congo's present transport system is geared mainly to the export trade, and is based on river navigation and on railroads which lead from river ports into regions producing minerals and agricultural commodities. Most of the roads radiate short distances from cities, providing farm-to-market communications. In recent years road traffic has increased rapidly with the growth of the internal market and the improvement of farming methods. The road program now being undertaken will encourage the change from subsistence agriculture to the cultivation of cash crops, open up tracts of unused land, and make possible a better and cheaper food supply for the urban population. participation • $6,497,000 maturing between 1961 and 1963, by 14 investment institutions which included The Royal Bank of Canada; The Chase Manhattan Bank; Brown Brothers Harriman & Co.; The New York Trust Company; The First National City Bank of New York; Belgian-American Banking Corporation, New York; and Swiss Credit Bank, New York Agency."
1957,"Nigeria, with a population of 34 million, covers an area of about 373,000 square miles. Its 1,780 miles of railway lines form the backbone of the transportation system, linking the productive inland regions with the Atlantic Ocean ports of Lagos and Port Harcourt. The rapid rise in production and trade since World War II has placed an increasing burden on the railways. In the last five years alone, freight carried by rail has risen by more than half to 2,050,000 tons a year. The current program will relieve this pressure by increasing carrying capacity, speeding up train movements and improving some sections of the permanent way to carry heavier loads."
1957,"The northeastern region is potentially rich and well suited to the production of peanuts and cotton for export and grains and livestock for the domestic market. At present, only a fraction of its potential is realized because of inadequate transportation; the new line will open up the region to expanded production and trade."
1957,"A Bank loan of $14 million was made in 1953 to help expand the capacity of the railways to meet the growing burdens imposed on them by the rapid development of production and trade after the war. The present need is to improve efficiency of operation rather than to add substantially to carrying capacity. Accordingly, the program for 1957-62 provides for improvements in permanent way, the extension of centralized traffic control, and the acquisition"

During the five years of the first Plan, which ended in March 1956, freight carried by rail grew by one-fifth, reaching 115 million tons a year. Growing production and trade continue to put increasing pressure on the railways. The aim of the current railway program is to increase freight capacity by 40%, from 115 million to 162 million tons a year by 1961, and to increase passenger capacity by about 15%. The total estimated cost of the program is equivalent to $2,363 million, of which $893 million will be required in foreign currencies."

Both projects are well situated with respect to marketing and transportation, the first lying between Rome and Naples, and the second enjoying good transport connections with large consuming centers in Italy and in Central Europe. It is estimated that the value of farm production in the areas will increase by the equivalent of $35 million annually. The two projects will create about 27,000 full-time jobs; in addition there will be more employment in trade, processing industries and transportation as a result of increased farm production."
1957,"This is the second Bank loan to assist the Government in creating an adequate highway system— one of Honduras' most urgent development needs. The projects now being undertaken are part of a larger program of highway development currently being carried out by the Government, and will make possible year-round road transport in important sections of the country. The new Puerto Cortes highway is expected to stimulate the economy in general by permitting cheaper and more efficient transport between the country's principal port and the interior. The Western Highway serves one of the most densely populated areas of Honduras and a potentially rich agricultural region. The Southern Highway, the most heavily traveled route in Honduras, is the only means of communication between the Pacific coast ports and Tegucigalpa and the interior; it is a main artery for foreign trade with El Salvador, and is now the only connection in Honduras with the Pan American Highway. The work is expected to take about 2Vi years to complete at a total cost equivalent to $10.5 million.

In July 1993, the Chinese authorities undertook measures to slow the torrid pace of growth and ease rising inflationary pressures. Malaysia and Thailand, two other prime recipients of foreign direct investment, once again displayed outstanding growth performance.

An improved economic climate has made foreign investment attractive in many countries; privatization of state-owned enterprises has also boosted inflows, especially in Latin America and Eastern Europe. China, by far, was the largest recipient of FDI, with $15 billion flowing into the country in 1993, up $4 billion over the 1992 total.3 In general, FDI continues to be concentrated in a limited number of developing countries: Five countries—in order of FDI amounts, China, Mexico, Argentina, Malaysia, and Thailand—received 59 percent of FDI Sows. Regionally, FDI favored East Asia ($25 billion), Latin America ($18 billion), and Europe and Central Asia ($9 billion). Flows to most low-income countries were stagnant, however, reflecting the slow growth of official flows and the lack of access of most of these countries to private capital markets.

The NAFTA’s main effect will be to improve the growth prospects of Mexico, which is required by the agreement to liberalize its policies the most and which should consequently experience a significant boost in its exports. Economic models estimate that in the short term, the NAFTA will be responsible for increased exports to the United States of 11 percent and 9 percent from Mexico and Canada, respectively, while exports to the United States from elsewhere could fall by small amounts. One drawback is that the NAFTA’s domestic content regulations could prevent the agreement’s three member countries from relying on some low-cost (non-NAFTA) sources of production inputs—a factor that would restrict the ability of members to use their NAFTA tariff and nontariff preferences.	."

A recent GATT study shows that the amount of world trade occurring within regions as a share of world GDP rose from 7 percent in 1948 to 17 percent in 1990, driven mainly by the performance of Western Europe. However, this rise did not choke off trade between regions, as the amount of intraregional trade as a share of GDP has remained fairly stable at between 15 percent and 16 percent."
1994,"The fiiture of “benign regionalism,” which minimizes harm to outsiders and contributes to world trade and welfare, depends critically on a commitment to maintaining and furthering openness and multilateral cooperation among trading blocs. In this regard, the successful completion of the Uruguay Round has helped to alleviate concern that the “new regionalism” might substitute for multilateral trade liberalization. In recognition of the potential threat posed by RIAs, the Uruguay Round strengthens existing GATT rules that forbid barriers against third parties from rising through the creation of an RIA. Further, the round will strengthen surveillance of RIAs, an effort that will undoubtedly be pursued by the new World Trade Organization (WTO), which will succeed the GATT in 1995. The WTO, designed by the Uruguay Round participants to enforce the GATT's free trade rules, will have the power to levy trade penalties against countries by a semijudicial disputes procedure that will no longer allow countries to ignore findings against them."
1994,"As was highlighted at a seminar on finance and private sector development for the Bank's executive board in March 1994, with governments everywhere reexamining their role in development and reorienting public sector activities to maximize efficiency, the private sector is increasingly being asked to help meet their development priorities. At the same time, today's worldwide trade and business patterns imply a higher competitiveness threshold and much higher standards of responsiveness for government institutions and firms alike."

FPD continued its analysis of success factors in energy-efficiency programs—with a view to designing better country-specific and market-based approaches for improving energy efficiency on both the supply and demand sides. Various initiatives assisted sectoral reforms in key countries. The Bank encouraged cross-fertilization through technical assistance, seminars, and workshops for policymakers, notably in Brazil, China, India, and several countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union."
1994,"During the past year. ESMAP assisted countries such as Bolivia, India, Morocco, and Poland in planning and carrying out a restructuring of key segments of their energy sector. ESMAP household and rural energy activities, one of the program’s long-term strengths, continued vigorously in Bolivia, Chad, India, Jamaica, Mali, Rwanda, and Viet Nam. Similarly, energy efficiency and conservation efforts, including institution and local capacity-building work and training in demand-side management, have been a major feature of ESMAP work in Brazil, China, Pakistan, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, and elsewhere. Oil and gas activities remained important in countries such as Mozambique and Morocco, as well as in several Central and Eastern European countries that have substantially underused capacities and an urgent need for reliable and clean energy sources. In this respect, trade issues associated with the development and use of natural gas resources are an area of particular emphasis for ESMAP's present and future activities."

1994,"alogue, allowed the Bank to listen to experts from outside, and Facilitated a consensus on the agenda for moving ahead. In the oil and gas sector, the Bank has sponsored workshops and conferences for investors and host countries to develop better understanding of gas trade and markets, and of opportunities for investment. It has also used these fora as a means of disseminating experience and best practices. In the same spirit, the Bank and the IFC worked with the government of Morocco and the private secto; on developing options for attaining quickly a higher threshold of competitiveness. As a follow up to this work, the Moroccan government hosted a major seminar in early June 1994 with the private sector on ways to improve the business environment and compete in global markets."
1994,"The principal reason for the turnaround in private flows has been the economic policy reforms of developing countries, especially privatization, fiscal consolidation, greater openness to trade, reduction of commercial bank debt overhangs, domestic price liberalization, and market-oriented reform. To an un-quantifiable extent, the World Bank has helped to foster the environment that has allowed these flows to increase through its support of policy reform."
1994,"Best practice and comparative studies were also undertaken to disseminate cross-country experience, and new instruments and approaches were designed to mobilize private finance for privatization and enterprise development. Six papers in the “CFS Discussion Papers” series were published, and three studies were launched, one assessing Eastern Europe's experience with medium-scale and large-scale trade sales, another comparing international postal reforms, and a third reviewing private sector support for the power sector in several developing countries."
1994,"Some of the highest growth rates were achieved by those countries, such as Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia that were recovering from the severe drought of 1991-92. The rather quick recov ’.ry of these and other countries from the effects of the drought is testimony to the. relative resilience of their economies and to the effectiveness of collaboration among their public administrations, donors, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The improvement in weather conditions was not generalized, however. Drought persisted in some areas, posing a serious threat in parts of Ethiopia and Kenya, and the countries of the western Sahel experienced poor rainfall. In addition, in these and other countries growth was held back by political transition, a high deb£ burden (despite debt forgiveness and reschedulings), a deterioration in the terms of trade, and weak policy implementation."
1994,"within sectors. Some countries (such as The Gambia, Sierra Leone, and Zimbabwe), where the implementation of reform programs is on track, nonetheless experienced low GDP growth rates due to the deterioration of their terms of trade, weather conditions, the lingering effects of the 1991-92 drought, or the disruptions caused by rebel activity and political transition. In contrast, other countries (such as Equatorial Guinea and Sudan, for example), where reform programs were lacking or offtrack, registered growth of 6 percent to 7 percent, helped by oil exports or favorable agricultural conditions. In yet other countries, results were uneven, with agricultural growth coinciding with a decline in industrial production and services, or a decline in overall exports accompanied nevertheless by an expansion of nontraditional exports. Contrasts also marked the implementation of policies. While the countries of the CFA Zone as a group failed to take the necessary measures to restore their competitiveness in 1993, many of them implemented significant structural reforms in the fiscal, financial, trade, and other areas. In several of the good performers, the improvements that took place were still inadequate, however: savings rates, for example, remained too low to support rapid, sustained growth, and social conditions continued unsatisfactory."
1994,"Pol.cy adjustments were undertaken to establish market-determined exchange rates; improve revenue mobilization, while reallocating or reducing government expenditures, especially investment; liberalize domestic prices (especially in agriculture), trade and tariff regimes, and agricultural marketing; introduce nondistortionary interest rates and strengthen financial sector regulation; enhance the efficiency of public enterprises and labor markets; and improve the coverage and quality of social services."
1994,"In 1990-92, Kenya witnessed s> sharp decline in all major macroeconomic performance indicators. However, in early 1993, the Kenya authorities signalled an interest in restarting the reforiii process, and, as a result, the condition* for strong medium-term growth in Kenya have improved significantly. Implementation of stabilization policies and more effective enforcement of financial sector regulations have sharply reduced runaway inflation (falling to an annual rate of around 15 percent during the last quarter of 1993 after peaking at around 100 percent during the second quarter). Important steps towards structural reform, particularly in the area of external trade, have begun to gradually restore domestic and international confidence in the government's commitment to reform. With the elimination of all but a short"

The spiral, in turn, was caused by a massive loss of competitiveness that resulted from a combination of the inflated cost structure existing in the mid 1980s and the major external shocks suffered since then. The prices of the Zone's major exports (coffee, cocoa, cotton, phosphate, uranium, and oil) dropped sharply in the second half of the 1980s, causing its terms of trade to fall by 40 percent between 1985 and 1992. The Zone’s real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciated by 39 percent over the same period. That movement was the result of the depreciation, since 1985. of the United States dollar and the large depreciation achieved by many competing developing countries of their own REERs through nominal devaluations in the context of economic reforms. The internal adjustment programs and structural reforms pursued by various CFA countries in the period 1986-93 were able neither to correct this massive loss of competitiveness nor halt the ongoing downward spiral."
1994,"The World Bank, together with the IMF, the European Commission for the European Union, and the African Development Bank, is cosponsoring an initiative to facilitate private investment, trade, and payments in Eastern and Southern Africa and in the Indian Ocean countries—the cross-border initiative (CBI)."
1994,"The CBI is based on a new integration concept that promotes mobility of factors, goods, and services across national boundaries among participating countries while minimizing chances for diversion of trade and investment. It involves voluntary participation by countries that are ready to accelerate the reform effort, and is based on the principle of reciprocity among the participating countries. The proposed reform measures are in the areas of trade liberalization, liberalization of the exchange system, deregulation of cross-border investment, strengthening of financial intermediation, and the movement of goods and persons among the participating countries. The reform agenda supported under the CBI has been developed through a two-year process of discussion by public and private sector representatives of the participating countries, as well as consultations with regional institutions."
1994,"Capacity building—as well as dialogue with the intended beneficiaries of development— continued to be the focus of the Bank's work in South Africa during the past year. In that country, the Bank's informal work has dealt with the entire political spectrum, including nongovernmental organizations, the private sector, teachers, and trade unions. Dozens of South Africans have been trained in economics, and relationships have been built up with many of the country's economic and political actors. In April 1994. the Bank opened up a resident mission. following a request from the multiparty South African transitional council."

1994,"The Pacific islands continue to face a unique set of development challenges: They are constrained by small domestic markets, a narrow resource and production base, and high unit costs of infrastructure; they are also heavily dependent on external trade and are vulnerable to external shocks and natural disasters. Despite an almost complete absence of absolute poverty, the islands are confronting acute environmental issues which, in some cases, will significantly affect their long-term economic outlook. Deforestation in the Solomon Islands, in particular, is an issue of major economic and environmental importance to the country. Papua New Guinea also faces important issues of deforestation and preservation of ecological diversity. It has recently enjoyed rapid growth fueled by rising mineral and new oil exports, but it must cope with problems of promoting growth in the rest of the economy."

About 80 percent of the population is emerging from socialism—more than in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union—while the middle-income countries of Korea. Malaysia, and Thailand comprise just S percent of East Asia's people. The significance of this is that East Asia has sustained rapid growth and far-reaching social and economic reforms at relatively low income levels and when their economies were undergoing major internal reforms. This augurs well and suggests that further inroads may be made in reducing poverty and protecting the environment as the reform process advances, underpinned by larger regional flows of trade and investment."

Although regional levels of protection are currently relatively high, reductions in tariff levels (on a nondiscriminatorv basis), now under way. are projected to increase penetration of foreign products and lower surpluses while boosting the region's growth and welfare. With the region expected to provide about half the incremental growth in world trade to the year 2000, this is a priority reform area. The Bank is advocating that East Asia become a more active participant in global trade discussions, reflecting the region's rise as a major importer and exporter."
1994,"Developing a leaner and more efficient public sector is only one part of the reform agenda. A dynamic private sector has an important complementary role to play to ensure sustained, high-quality growth. While notable advances have been made in recent years, much still remains to be done to improve the environment for private sector development in the region. In addition to continued public enterprise reform and privatization, infrastructure must be expanded and measures undertaken to improve die overall business environment through deregulation, further reductions in trade barriers, exchange-rate reforms, and financial sector development and integration— all key enabling factors necessary for private sector development."

1994,"The slowdown in the rate of growth in many Latin American countries appears to be mainly cyclical. It is partly the result of the recession in the industrialized world, which reduced demand for the region’s exports. The 4.5 percent fall in the region’s term of trade during 1993 reinforced the effect of this recession. In addition, .some countries that recently adopted reforms are still adjusting to a new set of widely different relative prices. Adjustment takes time, and the costs of resource realignment must be borne before benefits are reaped."

1994,"One of the most significant economic features of the late 1980s and early 1990s has been the dramatic increment in intraregional trade. This was due, first, to trade liberalization and second, to regional/bilateral trade agreements— MERCOSUR (Argentina, Brazil.

Trade has been opened up in most CARICOM countries (with the exception of Antigua and Barbuda, and Belize), the first stage of a common external tariff has been implemented, and nontariff trade barriers continue to be reduced. Representatives of twenty-two countries and several dependent territories in the Caribbean basin have con-eluded the first round of talks aimed at creating a new regional trading bloc."
1994,"The NAFTA is one of the world’s most comprehensive free-trade pacts (short of being a common market) among regional partners. Some provisions took place on January 1,1994, the day the agreement went into effect, and others will be implemented over a period of five, ten, and fifteen years. Special features include: the opening up of service sectors, particularly in finance, land transportation, and telecommunications; the immediate conversion of key agricultural restrictions into tariff-rate surcharges (which will be phased out in no more than fifteen years); the dismantling of tra-"
1994,"The most notable increment in intraregional trade has occurred in the MERCOSUR countries. From 1987 to 1993, the share of intramember trade increased from about 22 percent to almost 40 percent in Argentina; 13 percent to 23 percent in Brazil; and from about 30 percent to some 48 percent, in Uruguay. MERCOSUR has also changed the trade patterns of its partners. In 1990, for instance, the Brazilian government ceased providing incen-ti ves to its wheat producers, thus giving a boost to imports of cheaper Argentinian wheat; it is expected that Argentina wQl. eventually fill about 70 percent of Brazil's wheat-import needs. Argentina's substantial exports to Brazil during 1993 helped reduce its bilateral trade deficit from $1.7 billion to $600 million."
1994,"Trade between Argentina and Chile has also increased significantly, from about $600 million in 1990 to about $1 billion in 1993. Further economic integration will be boosted by the construction of new transAndean oil and gas pipelines. Moreover, since 1991, Chile has become one of the biggest investors in Argentina, with total investment of about $2.7 billion."
1994,"Although the increasing share of intra-regional trade might have involved some diversion of trade from the rest of the world, for many countries there was also significant trade creation: During the period 1987-93, Argentina expanded the value of its trade to GDP from 13 percent to 20 percent, Chile from 36 percent to 73 percent, Colombia from 37 percent to 44 percent, Costa Rica from 64 percent to 92 percent, Mexico from 25 percent to 39 percent, and the Caribbean countries from 67 percent to 78 percent. This aggregate expansion of trade decelerated in 1992, however, and came to a halt in 1993, as the ratio of exports to GDP remained roughly the same for most countries. Only seven countries increased (slightly) their exports during the year."
1994,"Overall trade expansion was stalled by two. events. The world demand for regional exports was weakened by recession in the industrial countries, and the exchange rate in many countries of the region appreciated as a result of large capital inflows, thereby reducing the international competitiveness of the region’s exports. These inflows are currently financing"
1994,"increased domestic expenditures and will pose important challenges if they slow down.9 This slowdown process will require significant relative price adjustments that may be difficult to engineer in countries with fixed or quasi-fixed nominal exchange rates. The possibility exists that a reduction in capital inflows might be answered by increased trade protection, thereby negating the effects of the recent opening up of international trade, which has been the backbone of the region’s reform effort."
1994,"The key to the enhancement of the region's competitive edge is increased productivity. This requires further trade liberalization, further deregulation of domestic markets (in particular, labor markets), and improvements in the supervision of the deregulation process. Deeper trade liberalization would increase productivity as economies shift their resources to areas of comparative advantage, and the region absorbs state-of-the-art technology. Further domestic market deregulation would also make economies more efficient and, consequently, more competitive. In Peru, for example, it is estimated that labor productivity in the manufacturing sector has increased by about 21 percent since the beginning of the 1990 reform program, which has emphasized both trade liberalization and domestic market deregulation."

But, in contrast to 1992, when growth was largely concentrated in construction and domestic services, 1993 saw a more broadly based pattern of growth.

1980,"Borrowing by centrally planned countries and organizations nearly doubled between 1978 and 1979, increasing from $3,702 million to $7,231 million. This increase is accounted for by China, which made its debut in the Eurocurrency credit market in 1979. This first-time borrower raised a total of $2,995 million through 12 loans at very low spreads. The high liquidity of banks enabled other centrally planned countries, for example Poland and the German Democratic Republic, to borrow actively and to achieve improved terms, as well."
1980,"On May 15, the Executive Directors decided that the Government of the People's Republic of China represented China in the Bank and its affiliates."
1980,"The decade of the 1970s1 was marked by a series of economic shocks: a notable slowdown in the growth of the developed countries, coupled with high rates of inflation; a dramatic rise in the price of crude oil, with its wide-ranging effects, which included a deterioration in the terms of trade of the oil-importing developing countries, hard hit also by increases in the costs of imported capital goods and food; a massive build-up of liquidity in the international capital markets; and unusually large fluctuations in commodity prices."
1980,"Inflation had diverse effects on the economies of the developed, as well as the developing, countries. For example, the tight fiscal and monetary policies pursued by the developed countries in response to inflation slowed growth and thus hampered increases in the volume of exports by the developing countries. The effect of inflation on countries with large debts and high, fixed-interest debt-service payments was favorable, however, as the real burden of repaying their debts was reduced. The effect of inflation on the terms of trade depended on the composition of the particular country's exports; generally speaking, the terms of trade of the exporters of petroleum and manufactured goods were not adversely affected, and may have even improved."
1980,World Trade Growth Rate Declines
1980,"There was a slowdown during the 1970s in the growth rate in the volume 10 of world trade (6%) relative to that of the 1960s (8%). As in the 1960s, the volume of exports from the developed countries expanded at a faster rate (6.7%) than that from the developing countries (5.4%). The slowdown in the rate of growth of exports from developing countries was due largely to the performance of fuels.11 The developing countries' export performance in manufactures in the 1970s exceeded that of the 1960s in spite of significantly lower growth in the industrialized countries and emerging protectionist pressures there.  Again, there"
1980,"were major differences among the various groups of countries. For example, the growth in the volume of exports from the middle-income, oil-importing countries, a group that includes the newly industrialized developing countries,12 maintained its rapid momentum of the 1960s. During the decade, there was a slow but steady change in the trading pattern of the developing countries as they expanded trade among themselves at a faster rate (8%) than they expanded their total trade (5% )."

1980,"The divergent trends in the price and volume of merchandise exports 16 have significantly changed the structure of world trade. Fuels, which represented 11 % of the value of world exports in 1960, accounted for 22% of exports in 1979, thereby surpassing nonfuel primary commodities in importance, the latter falling from 37% to 20% during the same period. Moreover, the developing countries' share of exports of nonfuel primary commodities declined. In 1960, the developing countries accounted for 40% and the industrialized countries for 50% of such trade; by 1979, however, their shares were 31 % and 61%, respectively. Countries with centrally planned economies and the capital-surplus, oil-exporting countries accounted for the remainder.

While similar suggestions were brought forward during the 1960s (at the meetings of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in 1964 and 1968), deteriorating economic conditions and the success of OPEC deepened the resolve of the developing countries to seek change during the 1970s. As a result, the UN General Assembly, in 1974, adopted the ""Declaration for the Establishment of a New International Economic Order"" (NIEO), and the resulting general and specific negotiating sessions arising from this declaration became parts of what was (and is) known as the North/South dialogue."
1980,"The ""new order"" called for was complex in its composition; among the basic elements are included questions of commodity agreements, trade, flows of concessionary assistance, generalized debt relief, reform of the international monetary system, more rapid industrialization of the developing world, transfers of technology, provision of assured and affordable supplies of foodgrains, and the establishment of a new Law of the Sea providing for development resources on the basis of a tax on undersea mineral exploration."
1980,"Important progress was also made in the conclusion of the Tokyo Round of multilateral trade negotiations, whereby tariff barriers against developing country exports to developed countries were reduced. But, as noted in last year's Annual Report, ""the most encouraging results of the Tokyo Round are to be found in the area of nontariff barriers to trade. This achievement was accomplished by a strengthening of GATT codes, including changes with respect to codes covering customs valuation, government procurement practices, export subsidies, countervailing duties, and product standards."""

That session will launch global negotiations to arrive at a consensus on several of the major international objectives identified by the strategy. Negotiations are expected to focus on food, energy, balance of payments, trade, finance, and raw materials."
1980,"but meet government targets regarding the creation of jobs. Trade policy and exchange rate regimes tended to bias incentives in favor of production for the home market and, given discouraging trends in farm income for much of the period, this market did not grow rapidly. Despite these limiting factors, lessons were learned and experience was gained. In the Sudan, for instance, the government decided in 1979 to define the role of the public sector more selectively than before; elsewhere, however, it will be necessary to rationalize the policy frame of parastatal entities and revamp institutional relationships so that public enterprises might achieve the objectives for which they were created."
1980,"Also contributing to the slowdown in the growth of GDP was the sharp deterioration in the Region's terms of trade. Between 1966 and 1974, the regional terms of trade index (1977=100) remained rather stable around an average of 153. Between 1974 and 1975, however, it fell by 37% and has since remained at a new plateau, averaging 95 for the period. The immediate reaction of many countries to the large deterioration in their external position was to draw down reserves and borrow abroad. As a result, net foreign assets fell precipitously in 1975 and, in several countries, turned negative. Although most countries had little access to the Eurodollar market, those few that did, borrowed commercially, and in large quantities. The servicing of this debt has since strained the borrowers' balance of payments, and, in several cases, arrears in payments accumulated for the first time. Financial pressures were also reflected in growing budget deficits and rising rates of inflation; average annual price increases, for instance, exceeded 10% in most countries and, in a few instances, were about 50%."
1980,"were reassessed in the light of available resources and the need to raise capacity utilization, as well as to complete ongoing projects. Sudan has already embarked on a program to raise cotton production and exports. Kenya has decided to rationalize its industrial and trade policies so as to improve efficiency and raise the level of manufactured goods for export. These measures have been supported by drawings from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and, in the case of Sudan, by a rescheduling of external debt by the Paris Club. In fiscal 1980, the Bank also convened meetings of consultative groups for Sudan, Uganda, and Zaire. These meetings were designed partly to mobilize additional assistance from donors; without such extra support in suitable form, it would be difficult to finance large transitional deficits in the balance of payments. It is recognized that these domestic and multilateral steps are the beginnings of a process that must be sustained for some considerable time. Other Eastern African economies will need to take similar steps to regain their development momentum."
1980,"The 1970s began for the countries of the Western Africa Region as a period of consolidation of post-independence progress, in building up more cohesive nation-states, in more effectively integrating national economies, and in taking steps to strengthen inter-African links. Beginning in late 1973, however, attention to this effort was diverted by a series of external shocks—the subject of detailed discussion in Chapter Two—whose cumulative effect was to affect adversely the Region's terms of trade. As they enter the 1980s, most countries in the Region find that they have not been able to adjust fully to the new international environment. It would have been difficult enough for Western African governments, as experience in other parts of the world has"
1980,"place in an environment that included wide fluctuations in commodity prices and a net deterioration in terms of trade. These fluctuations included the first, sudden increase in the price of petroleum. For the commodity producers, the impact of higher prices was clearly favorable; for the net oil exporters, Malaysia and Indonesia, oil revenues provided the means to finance development efforts. For the net oil importers, the rising cost of fuel imports made the growth of exports an ever growing need by the end of the decade."
1980,"Except in the oil-producing nations, Indonesia and Malaysia, the terms of trade deteriorated in the 1970s. The pattern, however, was not uniform; until the sudden oil price increases in 1974, and partly as a result of the surge in commodity prices of the previous year, the Philippines and Thailand experienced favorable terms of trade. The Philippines registered a 15% improvement between 1970 and 1974, but lost all the gain in the next three years. Thailand's terms of trade improved by 17% between 1970 and 1973, but then fell by 34% in the next five years. The cost of oil imports took a growing share of the value of exports; for the Philippines, the proportion rose from 10% in 1970 to 25% in 1979; for Thailand, from 9% to 22%; and for Korea, from 15% to 21%."

Essentially, in 1979 and 1980, all oil-importing countries in the Region suffered from the effects of high and rising prices of oil, the recessionary tendencies in the richer countries (that, in turn, have led to outbreaks of protectionism against imports of manufactures), and the worldwide spread of inflation. On the whole, growth rates have fallen—most notably in Korea, which had led the Region in growth. The two net oil-exporting countries—Malaysia and Indonesia—were exempt from this tendency, although they also did not experience such high rates of growth as in earlier years. On the whole, the terms of trade continue to be unfavorable to the Region, although much depends on each country's particular commodity composition of trade."

1980,"At the start of the 1980s, the Region faces persistent and massive development problems, and prolonged and sustained efforts are needed to alleviate them. Although these efforts must be made largely by the countries themselves, external financial aid and technical assistance will continue to play a vital role. To cushion the effects of the deterioration in the Region's terms of trade and to permit needed adjustments in the structure of investments and development policies, ways will have to be sought to secure larger capital inflows on suitable terms."
1980,"In Sri Lanka, average economic growth during much of the decade (1970-77) was 2.9% yearly, down from 4.4% in the 1960s. Growth was hampered by a persistent shortage of foreign exchange, inadequate levels of savings and investment, and an inefficient use of available resources. Continued high social expenditures, including those for food subsidies, were a major factor in declining (and ultimately negative) public savings. (In recent years, however, the country has successfully reduced the burden of its social programs as a proportion of the budget by focusing them on the lower-income groups.) Resource constraints were aggravated by seriously worsening terms of trade. The tree crops sector (tea, rubber, and coconut), the country's largest foreign exchange earner and the largest source of government revenues, suffered from neglect. Paddy production did not fare well either, in some years owing to bad weather, but due principally to deteriorating institutional support. The only bright spot in agriculture was the rapid expansion in output of subsidiary food crops (such as cassava, corn, chilies, onions, and potatoes). Manufacturing similarly suffered from resource constraints and inefficient management. Open unemployment increased, reaching over 1 million in 1977, or almost one-fifth of the labor force."

1980,"During the past decade, the countries of the Region have been subject to two major sets of economic forces, those largely international in origin (inflation, slower trade in recent years, rising energy costs, and changing patterns of international migration) and those whose origins were domestic (demographic pressures, food shortages, unemployment or underemployment, and a lack of facilities to deliver basic needs), thus creating a need for structural adjustments in production and consumption. Taking the Region as a whole (except for the special group of major oil exporters), its countries can be placed into two broad groups according to whether the net impact of these forces has been growth enhancing or growth inhibiting. In most nonoil-exporting countries, economic growth was somewhat less rapid during the second half of the decade than during the first half. This is evident from the accompanying table on average annual growth rates, which suggests that a loss of dynamism was the net result of the adjustments these countries made to inflation, recession in member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),"

Export earnings grew rapidly as a result of favorable world prices for the Region's major agricultural exports and significant increases in the volume of nontraditional exports. Favorable terms of trade during this period and increased medium-term and long-term capital inflows strengthened the Region's capacity to import. The increase in public debt service, the result of a growth in borrowing and a hardening of terms, was matched by a rapid growth of exports, and international reserve holdings of the monetary authorities increased fourfold."
1980,suffered declines in economic growth as a result of internal causes or the sharp deterioration of the external trade situation.
1980,"The current account deficit for the Region as a whole increased from $2,900 million in 1973 to $7,000 million in 1974 and $14,000 million in 1975; it then fell to $10,000 million in 1976. Initially, the increase in the deficit was the result of a surge of import payments associated with sustained economic growth throughout most of the Region, as well as by the increase in petroleum prices. A sharp deterioration in the Region's terms of trade during the period, 1975-76, stemming from a fall in the world prices of sugar, cotton, wheat, fish-meal, beef, copper, and tin was only partially offset by a decline in the volume of imports."
1980,"During 1979, rapid economic growth in the Region's three largest countries—Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico—and continued strong growth in Colombia, Chile, and Paraguay resulted in an increase in the Region's GDP of 6.5%. While the value of exports increased more than imports, rapidly rising interest payments on external debt and deteriorating terms of trade for the nonpetroleum-exporting countries resulted in large increases in the current account deficit in the balance of payments. While the 1979 current account deficit of $20,000 million exceeded that of any previous year in nominal terms, it was lower in real"
1980,"Despite the vulnerability of many countries in the Region to adverse developments in the world economy, prospects for economic growth in the future will be determined, to a considerable extent, by internal economic policies and the effectiveness with which each country manages its development program. While there has been a wide range of experience among individual countries in Latin America, many nonoil-exporting countries, such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Panama, and Peru, have increased energy prices toward the new, higher world level. As a consequence, these countries have been successful in curbing growth of energy consumption and in accelerating the development of energy sources, including petroleum. Those countries that have not been able to develop new sources of energy are likely to face increasing pressure on their balance of payments in the 1980s unless they can expand their nontraditional exports at a pace sufficient to offset rising expenditures on imports of petroleum. But, expanding exports in a period of universal slow growth will present a special challenge. For a number of countries, it has become clear that the maintenance of high rates of growth of non-traditional exports over the medium term will require an internationally competitive industrial sector that can come about only through gradual trade liberalization and other structural adjustments. The southern ""cone"" countries (Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay) have taken major strides toward opening up their economies and allowing market mechanisms to operate with minimal interference. The results, so far, are encouraging."
1980,"To suggest that national economic management is the most important factor determining future growth does not imply that developments in the world economy will not be important for countries in the Region. Clearly, the future trend of world petroleum prices and the availability of medium-term and long-term capital for development are critical determinants of growth for many countries. Equally important for the progress of the Latin American and the Caribbean countries will be the resumption of economic growth in the industrialized nations. Shifts in comparative advantage and in the pattern of trade between Latin America and the industrialized countries have been accompanied by adjustments, often quite difficult, in the developed countries. Protectionist pressures in the industrialized countries, as a consequence, have increased somewhat in recent years, as manufactured exports from developing countries penetrated markets in Europe and North America."
1980,"For Latin America, the problem of increased protection could become particularly acute, since an increasing share of its expanded manufactured exports goes to the industrialized countries. Throughout the Region, there is a growing recognition that increasing regional cooperation to promote trade and capital flows is an essential complement to good national economic management since, in the absence of such cooperation, the countries of Latin America will find it increasingly difficult to reconcile balance of payments and external debt management with their growth objectives."
1980,"An important achievement of the Caribbean Group, and one which, over the longer term, may be of great significance for the future development of the area, has been the strong impetus given to regional cooperation in the areas of export promotion, private sector development, tourism, energy, agriculture, and transportation. Regionwide cooperation in tourism promotion and in installing the infrastructure needed to generate additional tourism could make possible economies of scale and could spread the high cost of tourism over many countries. Cooperation involving the transport network is centered on improving inter-island shipping to accelerate trade. To formulate long-term solutions to the severe energy problem faced by most countries, efforts are being made to create a comprehensive energy planning capability in the region, to develop indigenous, unconventional energy sources, to initiate energy conservation programs, and to prepare energy development projects, including the exploration and development of hydrocarbon resources. In the area"

Such lending has supported reconstruction activities, has helped meet the need to supply industrial raw materials and equipment to raise the use of existing industrial capacity, has aided economies adversely affected by a sudden fall in export earnings (where the economy is critically dependent on a single export item), and has been used to bolster economies hit by a sharp deterioration in terms of trade as a result of a rapid rise in import prices.

Life expectancy has risen from 67 to 68 years in the same period, compared with 64 years for all developing countries. Adult illiteracy has been reduced from 29 percent in 1985 to 24 percent in 1990, and given the current secondary enrollment rate of 52 percent (46 percent for girls), the region is likely to achieve the Bankwide objective—set by Bank President James Wolfensohn at the United Nations Conference on Women in Beijing—of providing access to secondary education to 60 percent of children by 2010."

Meeting this challenge will require large-scale private sector involvement for financing and efficiency. During the past year, in ""Infrastructure Development in East Asia and Pacific: Towards a New Public-Private Partnership,” the Bank laid out an overall agenda to enhance private sector participation. The Bank explored the possibility of establishing an Infrastructure Fund in the Philippines, developed a cofinancing strategy with the private sector, and undertook a large number of other activities at the project, sector, and country level to enhance private sector involvement. In addition, recent economic and sector work has included infrastructure studies for China, Indonesia, Mongolia, and Vietnam."

To this end, the Bank has recently conducted studies and provided policy advice on banking sector reforms, capital market development, and state-owned enterprise (sof.) reforms in China, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Two regional studies, Managing Capital Flows in East and The Emerging Asian Bond Market, were widely disseminated in an international conference in Hong Kong in mid 1995.^ The conference was a success on all fronts: Participation was greater than expected, both public and private sectors showed keen interest, and press coverage was comprehensive and highly favorable."
1996,"lations create the need and demand for formal mechanisms of social insurance. The design of social insurance systems is critical because poorly designed systems can have large and potentially adverse fiscal and labor-market consequences. There are potentially significant benefits from sharing experience in developing sound systems of old age, health, unemployment, and disability insurance. To this end, the Bank has recently carried out formal and informal studies on pension reforms in China, Indonesia, and Thailand, and provided policy advice on the design of these systems based on its worldwide experience. A Health Care Financing study was conducted for China, and Education Cost and Financing studies were undertaken for the Philippines and Vietnam. Because development of social insurance systems is still at an early stage, lending projects were few and accounted for less than 1 percent of the past year's commitments. In the $20 million Labor Market Development Project in China, employee benefits—pensions, unemployment insurance, and medical coverage—are being transferred on a pilot basis from soes to the administration of five municipalities. This action is the first step in overall social insurance reform and is intended to accelerate the redeployment of surplus labor to other productive activities."
1996,"Dealing with environmental problems continues to be a top priority of the Bank’s activity. The Bank’s strategy is to help the region’s countries correct the underpricing of environmental costs and to build the institutional capacity for sound environmental management and a healthy and attractive urban environment. A study, East Asia's Environment: Principles and Priorities for Action, focused on underpricing, proposed market-based instruments for government regulations, and recommended priorities for action. Subjects of economic and sector work (ksw) included industrial pollution control (Indonesia and Vietnam), renewable energy (China), and biodiversity and forestry (Cambodia)."
1996,"Maintaining macroeconomic stability has been at the heart of East Asia's success. The Rank continues to analyze the macroeconomic situation in relation to structural reforms. For example, it is helping China build institutional capacities to deal with an overheated economy and is supporting government efforts at economic recovery and growth in the Philippines."
1996,"In addition to country economic memoranda, which each year analyze individual macroeconomic conditions, the Bank conducted public expenditure reviews in the Lao mu and the Philippines and provided public investment analysis to China on ways to maintain a sound fiscal and macroeconomic policy environment."

1996,"The Bank’s activities in the region have been directed by this emerging development agenda. There has been a shift in its lending activities from the region's middle-income countries to the low-income Indochinese countries. Total commitments in fiscal 1996 were $5.4 billion, while gross disbursements and net disbursements were $4.1 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively."
1996,"Net transfers, taking account ot interest as well as of principal repayment, were a negative $925 million (see table 4 5). Lending to China, a “blend” country, accounted tor 55 percent of the total. Thirteen percent ot the lending volume was to low-income, ida-only countries (Cambodia, Lao pdr, Mongolia, and Vietnam), compared with 6 percent in the period fiscal 1993-95. Net transfers to China and the three Indochinese nations—Cambodia, Lao for, and Vietnam— amounted to almost $1.4 billion, while the mature borrowers—Korea (which ‘ graduated’’ from IBRD lending in fiscal 1995), Malaysia, and Thailand—became net repayers as their share of new lending from the Bank either stabilized or declined. These borrowers, however, continue to make use of the Bank for special studies and projects in innovative areas."
1996,"This transition has been made necessary by the extraordinary change taking place in the global economy, with explosive growth in worldwide trade and private investment centering on the emerging market economies. In the 1990s, developing countries have contributed 70 percent of the growth in global gdp and half the growth in world trade. Private investment flows to the developing world have more than tripled, from around $44 billion in 1990 to nearly $170 billion by the end of 1995."
1996,"The Budget Committee reviewed institutional initiatives proposed by the president with an eye to their effect on the budget and the board’s desire to stay very close to previously agreed budget reductions. They asked management to explain its justifications for the initiatives, as well as detailed cost estimates, possible tradeoffs with other Bank programs, and redeployment options. The new initiatives will be paid for largely out of efficiency gains or budget reductions elsewhere."
1996,"oed’s country-assistance review for Ghana raised generic issues for the Bank's planning and management of cass. The code pursued these issues with management. They included the Bank’s propensity to underestimate the time required to implement policy-reform programs and achieve a sustained response from producers; the need for cass to reflect the political economy; the need to design trade-liberalization programs flexibly, with an eye to costs as well as benefits; the need for consistent, thoroughgoing efforts to promote partnership and borrower participation in Bank operations; the need for high-quality, judiciously timed economic and sector work and thorough analysis of proposed operations; and skill mix, staffing, and vvork-location issues."
1996,"Investments in people will not be effective unless governments establish an economic framework that ensures macroeconomic stability, markets that are open for trade and investments, the right structure of incentives, proper social sector policies, and efficiently functioning capital and labor markets. It is not a question of choosing between investing in people and sound economic policies—it must be both. They go hand in hand and reinforce each other to replace the vicious circle of poverty with the virtuous circle of growth and progress. This approach is at the core of the work and research performed by hcd’s two departments, Poverty and Social Policy (psp) and Human Development (hdd)."
1996,"Labor-market issues are increasingly attracting the Bank’s attention, both in its lending operations and its analytical work.

The countries participating in these arrangements are taking steps to remove the barriers to cross-border flows of goods, factors, and people. The Bank supports these efforts through technical and policy advice, institution building, and financing in the context of country-specific assistance programs."

1996,"In 1995, South Asian economies grew by 5.3 percent. India continued to reap substantial benefits from the trade and investment-1 liberalization reforms undertaken after 1991. Helped by favorable monsoons, growth is estimated to be around 6 percent, while manufacturing output growth has averaged 10 percent in the past two years. In Nepal growth reached a respectable 4.5 percent, and in Pakistan growth recovered after being held down by a series of poor cotton crops. By contrast, in Bangladesh and in Sri Lanka political difficulties and the continuation of civil strife, respectively, have contributed to dampen private sector dynamism and restrain growth."
1996,"Export performance remained vigorous, reflecting trade reforms, exchange adjustments and buoyant world demand. Since 1991, the annual average export growth rate for the region has exceeded 10 percent, compared with an average of 5.6 percent for the 1981-90 period. Nevertheless, exports of goods and nonfactor services represent less than 15 percent of domestic output, well below the average for developing countries. Although recent reforms have succeeded in lowering trade barriers, South Asian tariffs remain far higher than those in other regions. As a result, they remain an impediment to growth because, in conjunction with other trade restrictions, they create distortions"
1996,"Regional cooperation received a boost with the ratification by members of the South Asia Association of Regional Cooperation (saarc) of a trade agreement that included bilateral trade concessions that brought about cuts, ranging from 10 percent to 100 percent in tariff rates covering more than 220 items. Although the trade impact is likely to be small given the low share of intraregional trade, the saarc countries11 have indicated their intention to initiate negotiations towards establishing a free trade area in the near future."
1996,"Achieving major poverty reduction is feasible. But to sustain more rapid growth and integration in the world economy in the coming years, South Asian nations will face tough policy challenges that include addressing the deficiencies in social areas, dealing with infrastructure bottlenecks, reducing still-excessive trade and investment barriers, and extending the scope of competition in domestic factor and product markets."
1996,"Social consensus is critical to the sustainability of the economic transition in the countries of the region. As understanding of its newer member countries and rapport with its clients have grown, the Bank is increasingly listening to, and seeking advice from, nongovernmental organizations (ngos), community groups, local governments, public service providers, trade unions, the academic community, and the growing private sector. The Armenia Social Investment Fund Project, for example, aims to promote self-help and community solidarity. The project was designed based on the lessons learned from a pilot implemented by an ngo. With financial support from the project, the communities identify eligible microprojects based on their priorities, manage the implementation of their microproject, select contractors and supervisors, and devise a plan for maintaining the facility after microproject completion. A project to support the divestiture of housing from Russian enterprises incorporated the views and concerns of tenants into both project design and the implementation process through surveys of tenant preferences and the establishment of condominium associations as the most effective way to encourage voluntary resident participation in decisions. Through the Bank's Economic Development Institute (f.di), the Bank is supporting seminars to inform parliamentarians and a broad range of civil society— in the Kyrgyz Republic and Ukraine, for example—on transition issues. The elm, with financial support from Switzerland, also organized the Former Yugoslav Republic (fyr) of Macedonia's Forum for Senior Policymakers (""Vision of the Future”), which brought together the country’s president, parliamentarians, private sector representatives, academics, journalists, and out-of-country policymakers with relevant experiences to share for a wide-ranging dicussion of the future of the country."

The region, at a minimum, must sustain the robust export performance of 1995, when the nominal value ot total exports increased by 22.7 percent over 1994. In Mexico and Argentina, exports responded particularly well to the new economic circumstances, growing at 33.2 percent and 30.1 percent, respectively, in 1995. During the next eighteen months, a rapid recovery of these economies will require maintaining the momentum in export expansion, as well as a"

There is also scope for productivity increases through port reform and privatization, as well as the application of international quality standards."
1996,Reducing urban poverty will require increasing employment opportunities for the urban poor; extending access to urban services; making social safety nets more effective in urban areas; increasing the productivity of the informal economy; increasing labor-force participation rates; and reforming municipal administration. Reducing rural poverty will require eliminating regulatory barriers to enable the agricultural sector to take advantage of trade liberalization. Increasing the access of the rural poor to land and social services is another important requirement for rural poverty reduction.

After some weakening in 1980, when growth was negative, Korea bounced back in 1981 with a growth rate of 7.1 percent. A fractional slide in the overall growth rate for the region resulted mainly from the reduced expansion in 1981 in the net material product of China.

In the past year, further reform of the industrial sector has been impeded by problems of macroeconomic imbalance. But reform of the agricultural sector has made major advances, with widespread devolution of responsibility from production teams to individual households and groups of households. There has also been a strengthening of economic relations between China and other countries through trade, investment, exchange of information, and a limited amount of borrowing, all of which are expected to contribute to greater efficiency."

Excluding petroleum, the volume of world trade increased in 1981 by an estimated 2.5 percent, down from its 4.5 percent growth in 1980.

The volume of world exports of manufactures increased by 3 percent."
1982,"The value of world merchandise trade in 1981 was about 1 percent less than the $2,000 billion figure attained in 1980. With the exception of petroleum, dollar unit values for the major product categories entering world trade declined in 1981. The price declines were much more pronounced for primary products exported by the developing countries than for those exported by the industrial countries."
1982,"For the first time, the value of the developing countries' manufactured exports surpassed that of their exports of primary products, excluding petroleum. Apart from the long-term structural shift and their increased capacity to supply manufactured goods, this was also the result of price declines for raw-material exports (excluding oil) and a weak demand for primary products. Trade among developing countries has been steadily expanding at a rate faster than the total trade of the developing countries. Recent data are not available, but the current recession in the industrial countries should have encouraged developing-country exporters to push their products even harder in other developing-country markets, particularly in those of the oil exporters. Trade among developing countries has been aided by the fact that their GNP has been growing at a rate faster than that of the industrial countries."
1982,Terms of Trade
1982,"The terms of trade of developing countries— reflecting movements in commodity prices and changes in exchange rates—have exhibited an unprecedented degree of variability over the past several years. Although the terms of trade of developing countries as a group showed no movement over the period 1978-81, there were major shifts among groups of countries and even sharper variations among individual countries."
1982,"The terms of trade of the oil-exporting developing countries improved by 43 percent in 1978-81; the improvement was spread over the years as oil prices rose sharply relative to other prices. The gains were shared by all countries in the group, although gains varied from year to year. However, smaller gains went to Malaysia, because of adverse price movements in its exports of commodities other than oil (rubber, palm oil), and to Tunisia and Ecuador, because of the relatively small share of oil in their total exports."
1982,"The oil-importing developing countries, on the average, experienced a net decline of 13 percent in their terms of trade over the period 1978-81. Most of the decline occurred in 1980. This loss reflects the increase in the price of imported oil, the rise in the prices of manufactured imports, and the decline in the prices of most commodity exports."
1982,Declines in the terms of trade over this period were not peculiar to any particular region. But the average declines were distinctly larger for the low-income countries and for those countries still heavily dependent on the export of one or two primary products. These countries have little flexibility in expanding and adjusting their export mixes.
1982,"Global negotiations. No agreement has so far been reached in the United Nations on procedures for the conduct of negotiations on trade, energy, raw materials, development finance, and monetary issues, although the original timetable called for the negotiations to be completed by 1981. Differences between the developed and developing countries on procedures for negotiations on monetary and financial issues, and on the role of the specialized agencies have proved particularly difficult."
1982,"Cancun summit. An economic summit of twenty-two heads of state from the developed and developing countries—nine industrialized countries and thirteen developing countries from each of the regions (including China)—met in Cancun, Mexico, in October 1981. The co-chairmen of the meeting were the President of Mexico, Jose Lopez Portillo, and the Prime Minister of Canada, Pierre Trudeau. At its conclusion, the co-chairmen's summary stressed the importance of promoting closer international cooperation and confirmed the desirability of supporting, at the United Nations, a consensus to launch global negotiations on a basis to be mutually agreed and in circumstances offering the prospect of meaningful progress. Major issues discussed at the summit were food security and agricultural development, commodities, trade, industrialization, energy, and monetary and financial matters."
1982,"nisms were considered under the Program of Action developed by the Group of 77 in Caracas, Venezuela, in May 1981 for the promotion of economic cooperation among the developing countries, such as technical assistance to the Group of 77 and the scheduling of technical meetings in the fields of finance, science and technology, food and agriculture, new and renewable sources of energy, trade, industrial-manpower training, and technical cooperation."
1982,"ing in Melbourne, Australia, in October 1981 issued the Melbourne Declaration, stating that it was imperative to revitalize the dialogue between the developed and the developing countries. They reviewed current international economic issues in the fields of finance, trade and protectionism, commodities, energy, and food, and called for international action to increase official development assistance, support the Sixth and Seventh Replenishments of IDA, strengthen the role of multilateral institutions, reduce protectionist tendencies, and sign and ratify the Common Fund Agreement. Special action to provide assistance for energy development and to deal with the precarious world food situation was also called for."
1982,"First, increased attention will be given to the impact of country sectoral policy on the productivity and living standards of the poor and be made an important part of the Bank's policy dialogue with borrowers. Shifts in resource allocations and general policy changes—for example, the impact of trade liberalization or changes in fiscal or price policy—are powerful instruments for poverty alleviation and can have much greater impact on the well-being of large numbers of poor people than most individual projects. While there is still much to learn, structural-adjustment programs will consider, as far as possible, how the burdens of adjustment are shared among income groups, and how adverse effects on the poor, for example, through increased unemployment, higher prices of basic goods, or higher taxes, can be mitigated. Bank research will give high priority to reducing the gaps in its knowledge of the effects on the poor of macroeconomic policies, including alternative routes toward structural adjustment."
1982,"Impact on the poorest. Two sets of measures frequently incorporated in structural-adjustment programs tend to benefit the poor by increasing employment and rural incomes. They are the improvement of agricultural producer prices and the removal of widespread biases in incentive systems that favor capital-intensive industries and discourage exports. However, countries introducing programs of reform not only confront reduced disposable incomes as a consequence of adverse movements in their terms of trade, but, in addition, they must ensure increased allocations of resources to both investment and the fuller use of existing capital investment in industry, agriculture, energy, and other sectors that can contribute to easing balance-of-payments constraints. The Bank, therefore, has been concerned to ensure that in designing structural-adjustment programs, their impact on the poorest members of society and on programs of"
1982,"The IBRD does not trade in any currencies for its own account. Adjustments arising from translation of currencies to US dollar equivalents do not result in realized gains or losses as would occur with actual conversions into US dollars. Because of this, the General Reserve, rather than net income, is charged or credited annually with the amount of adjustment resulting from currency depreciations or appreciations. In fiscal 1982, the translation of currencies into US dollar equivalents resulted in a debit to the General Reserve of $279 million, compared with $582 million debited in fiscal 1981. (A more detailed explanation is provided in the ""Notes to Financial Statements."")"
1982,"Domestic reforms called for included the elimination of inefficient trade regimes and overvalued exchange rates that have contributed to poor export performance; the establishment of an appropriate institutional framework—involving agricultural research, extension services, infrastructure, procurement and marketing arrangements—designed to increase agricultural production; greater efficiency in parastatal bodies; and development of increased capacity for project evaluation and policy formulation."
1982,"Since its publication, the report's contents have been discussed in many different fora with African officials and aid agencies. At a meeting held in early March 1982 in Dakar, Senegal, the report was formally reviewed by the African Governors of the Bank and the Fund. In the Memorandum issued on that occasion, the Governors found that external factors such as high interest rates, energy prices, terms of trade, and levels of development assistance had all evolved unfavorably in recent years and were largely responsible for the economic crisis facing African countries. At the same time, the Governors ""fully recognized that it is necessary to make efficient use of available resources, be they human or financial, public or private"" and that ""adjustment and constant readaptation"" of development policies were needed. Certainly, both external and domestic developments over the past years have abundantly justified the Governors' concerns."
1982,"In 1981, the volume of imports continued to decline in most countries, including even those (Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan, and Zambia, for instance) that recorded some improvement in 1980. The rise in the external deficit in 1981 was caused mainly by a serious deterioration in terms of trade that was not matched by an adequate expansion of the volume of exports."
1982,"With external debt increasing and exports stagnating, the debt service of the region as a whole had absorbed about 18 percent of export revenue in 1980; there was no sign of improvement in 1981. Several countries are facing acute debt difficulties. Sudan, Zaire, and Zambia have been in this position for several years. Two of the three, Sudan and Zaire, sought a restructuring of debt under the auspices of the Paris Club during the past year. So, too, did Madagascar and Uganda. The total external debt of the ten largest countries rose from $13,900 million in 1979 to approximately $19,000 million in 1981. High interest rates in world credit markets have further increased the burden of debt and discouraged new borrowings on commercial terms. Some countries have accumulated arrears in external debt or other payments. The combined impact of deteriorating terms of trade, rigidity in the volume of exports, and limited access to external capital has compelled Eastern African countries to operate under a very tight constraint on imports."
1982,"Economic developments over the past eighteen months in Western Africa, just as in Eastern Africa, have taken place in an international setting that has remained less than favorable. Indeed, relative to 1980, export prices for practically all major commodities exported by the region have declined by between 10 percent and 20 percent. Even though there is evidence that increases in import prices have moderated (and in some instances, have even declined), the terms of trade for most, if not all, Western African countries have continued the decline that has been especially pronounced since 1979 for the oil-importing countries. Coffee prices (in 1981 constant dollars) have drastically declined, from USe737 a kilo in 1977 to USe283 a kilo in 1981. For cocoa, the decline in prices was equally sharp. These deep declines have caused, for example, Ivory Coast's terms of trade to deteriorate by about 40 percent between 1977 and 1982."
1982,"percent; growth was strongest in the manufacturing sector, which experienced an increase of about 15 percent. There was some increase (by between 6 percent and 8 percent) in trade and services, as well. Growth in agricultural output continued to be insignificant, however. Overall, because of the importance of the oil sector, the economy experienced almost no growth in overall GDP in 1981, while inflation continued at an estimated rate of between 12 percent and 15 percent."
1982,"markets (associated with economic recovery in the industrial countries) will only marginally help Western African countries to overcome their current economic problems. In essence, this is so because it would be unreasonable to expect any dramatic improvement in terms of trade or in borrowing conditions, or any large increase of official development aid; because, also, the nature and depth of the problems, in most countries, are not amenable to quick solutions under the best of circumstances. Measures required to achieve structural adjustment will take time to bear fruit and produce needed benefits. They include reform of public enterprises that involves new patterns of organization, management, and financing; the design of new forms of rural development that emphasize greater participation by farmers; and analysis and reform of incentive systems. In addition, problems from the past will haunt many of the region's countries for years, problems stemming, for instance, from high levels of debt service and from excessive recurrent costs generated by past investments, by newly hired government personnel, and by expanded social services."
1982,"The global recession has acted as a brake upon economic growth in all countries of the region, either through a deceleration in exports, or through raising the real cost of imports of goods and services. On the export side, the environment for international trade, characterized by declining or stagnant markets for manufactured goods (the result of recession and growing protectionism) became more difficult. In addition,"
1982,"The Philippines, a third oil-importing, middle-income country, also suffered under the impact of the world recession in 1981. Even though the country has been successful in holding down the volume of oil imports, its balance-of-payments deficit on current account rose to 6 percent of GNP in 1981, an amount well above the figure that could be sustained in the long term. The country's main economic problem has been a continued deterioration in its terms of trade that goes back as far as the oil-price increases of the early 1970s, but which has been especially significant since 1979. From 1974 to 1980, for example, the Philippines' terms of trade declined by 20 percent. The most recent decline has been caused primarily by its structure of imports and exports. Imports are mainly composed of those raw materials, fuels, and manufactured products that are essential to the country's industries. Though all these imports have become more expensive, the prices of the country's traditional exports—agricultural products and minerals—have fallen. Rapidly growing exports of manufactures have only partially offset these adverse movements. Another significant contribution to the balance-of-payments deficit in 1981 was the weight of interest payments, for just like Korea and Thailand, the Philippines has endeavored to maintain the momentum of its development by borrowing at variable rates of interest on world financial markets."
1982,"Of even greater importance have been reforms in the system of economic management aimed at providing lower-level units with more freedom of maneuver, stronger incentives to seek efficiency and serve the needs of consumers, and better signals regarding economic constraints and needs. In the past year, further reform of the industrial sector has been impeded by problems of macroeconomic imbalance. But reform of the agricultural sector has made major advances, with widespread devolution of responsibility from production teams to individual households and groups of households. There has also been a strengthening of economic relations between China and other countries through trade, investment, exchange of information, and a limited amount of borrowing, all of which are expected to contribute to greater efficiency."
1982,"trade moved in the country's favor, gross domestic income actually rose by 15.8 percent. Current and capital expenditures of the government were high, as were levels of private investment. The picture in 1981 was different, however. GDP growth was around 7 percent and merchandise exports showed only a small nominal increase. The all-important oil component increased by 8 percent in nominal terms; in 1980, the increase had been 47 percent. The value of exports other than oil in 1981 actually fell by over 20 percent, and the current account of the country's balance of payments was in deficit for the first time in three years."
1982,"Economic growth in South Asia, which had been impressive in fiscal 1981, partly reflecting recovery from a depressed 1980, continued during 1982, although at a somewhat slower pace. The reductions in growth rates resulted, to a considerable degree, from the widening recession among industrial countries. In several instances, such as in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, economic activity was also affected by poor weather that hurt agricultural growth and, as a result, aggravated balance-of-payment problems. The balance of payments of most countries continued to suffer from substantial deficits, reflecting large petroleum-import bills; the problem was intensified in 1982 by a recession-induced weakening of terms of trade."
1982,"While the recovery phase is now largely complete, the Indian economy is left with some severe imbalances. Evidence of this was present in fiscal 1982. Despite a domestic savings rate of over 20 percent, resources for investment remain tight. Because of adverse movements in the terms of trade, the balance of payments continues to be a problem. The likelihood of persistent current-account deficits in the coming years means that India's investment program will rely more on external resources than in the 1970s. With concessional aid flows declining, the task of adjusting India's external position has become at once both more complicated and more pressing."
1982,"In particular, policies to promote exports and, where appropriate, replace imports with expanded and more efficient domestic production are needed to cure the trade imbalance. Domestic energy development is an important component of such a strategy, and an increase in the supply of domestic energy would also help ease bottlenecks in the supply of infrastructural"
1982,"Aided by a record harvest in fiscal 1981, GDP in Bangladesh grew by roughly 7 percent in that year. While the acceleration in growth can. in part, be attributed to favorable weather conditions, there have, in addition, been substantial improvements in the framework of agricultural policy, especially with regard to the provision of inputs. Export efforts were mounted, leading to higher exports in volume; declining terms of trade, however, led to a decline in foreign-exchange earnings—even in nominal terms. Economic growth in Bangladesh continues to be subject to the vagaries of the weather, however, and economic growth in fiscal 1982 was substantially lower than in 1981. Drought led to a fall of 5 percent in the production of food grains, while shortages of inputs arising from an extremely tight external-payments situation had an adverse effect on industrial production."
1982,"The prospects for economic growth in Bangladesh are clouded due to severe financial problems—both external and domestic. While the economy was partially insulated from the effects of the 1979 oil-price rise as a result of a jump in the prices of jute goods in fiscal 1980, the terms of trade deteriorated by 22 percent in fiscal 1981 and by a further 15 percent in fiscal 1982. In spite of increases in export volumes, prices of major exports, in particular jute, declined substantially as a result of the slowdown in economic growth in the industrial countries. Import prices, on the other hand, continued to increase. This situation was aggravated by a decline in aid disbursements in real terms. In fiscal 1982, the cost of importing petroleum accounted for over 80 percent of the country's total export earnings. The cumulative impact of this deterioration in"
1982,"the terms of trade was estimated to be equivalent to roughlv 4 percent of gross national product (GNP) in fiscal 1981 and 1982. The effects of the terms-of-trade deterioration were exacerbated by a stagnation (in nominal terms) of commodity-aid disbursements. This stagnation, coupled with the decline in the terms of trade and the resulting constraints on import growth, placed considerable pressure on the government budget. While the government had some recourse to deficit financing, the major burden of adjustment occurred at the level of development expenditures: In fiscal 1982, the level of public development expenditures was estimated to be some 7 percent lower in real terms than levels reached two years earlier."
1982,"Bangladesh's balance of payments is characterized by a massive trade deficit that reflects deep-seated structural imbalances in the economy: The country has a small export base that is highly concentrated in a few commodities. Import requirements are more than twice the level of foreign-exchange earnings from exports and workers' remittances. As a consequence, the scope for adopting short-term measures to adjust to the growing balance-of-payments constraint is limited. The government did take some significant steps during fiscal 1982, however, including an exchange-rate depreciation of some 12 percent (in relation to a reference basket of currencies) and restraints on the growth of liquidity, to restore some degree of financial"
1982,"The strong economic performance of recent years in Pakistan continued in fiscal 1982. The growth rate in the GDP of 5.7 percent in fiscal 1981 was approximated in fiscal 1982 despite a number of adverse developments, including less-favorable weather conditions. Pakistan's balance of payments has been assisted in recent years by a significant improvement in exports, a rapid increase in workers' remittances, a rescheduling of official concessional debt by bilateral members of the Pakistan Consortium, and agreement with the International Monetary Fund on a three-year financing from its Extended Fund Facility. These factors helped to cushion the impact of the oil-price rises of 1979 and 1980. The balance of payments, at the same time, has remained difficult and has been affected by lower world prices for cotton and textiles (as a result of the worldwide recession) and depressed export prices for rice (a result of high levels of production in a number of exporting countries). Successful balance-of-payments management will require a vigorous continuation of recent, encouraging reforms to strengthen productivity and trade performance."
1982,"twice that for 1980. Among the many factors that account for this substantial increase in the current-account deficit, three stand out: a significant rise in the country's oil-import bill, a substantial decline in the rate of growth of workers' remittances, and deteriorating terms of trade, largely the result of the strong appreciation of the US dollar against the escudo, the increase in energy imports, and the impact of drought."
1982,"The country's trade adjustment was achieved primarily through increases in exports, which grew (in real terms) by about 10 percent in each of the past two years. At the same time, imports—of machinery and equipment, in particular—were cut back sharply. The switch of resources to the external sector has been made possible through the application of a stabilization program, supported by the IMF, that consists of tight demand-management policies that are coupled with exchange-rate adjustments. Monetary policy, in particular, has been used to reduce investment expenditure sharply. Notwithstanding these policies and the slowdown in growth, inflation was a major problem in the second half of 1980 and the first half of 1981. Stringent price-control measures did, however, succeed in reducing the inflation rate substantially in the latter part of 1981. The country's medium-term adjustment strategy is defined by its 1981-85 plan, which aims for a steady reduction in the share of investment in GDP, the diversion of these resources into the production of goods for exports, and the continuation of major import-substitution projects in the areas of"
1982,"Jordan enjoyed a high rate of growth of GDP (10 percent) in 1981, with the industrial sector leading the expansion. There was, however, a substantial widening of the trade deficit, due to both a marked slowdown in the earnings from phosphate exports and a rapid increase in imports. A significantly higher inflow of workers' remittances helped finance the deficit. The country's new five-year plan (1981-85), which was reviewed by the Bank, places special emphasis on manpower training and industrial development issues."
1982,"10 percent—it has already yielded some positive results that are helping erect a more efficient economic structure; in addition, the program has led to a turnaround in the country's trade deficit. Most countries of Central America and the Caribbean were particularly affected by unfavorable terms of trade."
1982,"As a result of these price movements, many countries in the region suffered large terms-of-trade losses. For the oil-importing countries as a whole, this loss is estimated at about $6,000"
1982,"million, equivalent to some 12.5 percent of their exports of goods in 1981. On the other hand, the principal net exporters of fuels (Mexico and Venezuela) improved their terms of trade in 1981 by about $5,000 million, equivalent to 11 percent of their merchandise exports."
1982,"In response to the external shocks, several countries adopted adjustment policies that aimed at restoring equilibrium between aggregate supply and demand, narrowing the imbalance in foreign trade, and reducing recourse to foreign borrowing. Through combinations of monetary and fiscal policies, the oil-importing countries of the region were able to expand the volume of their exports by 13 percent and, at the same time, reduce the volume of imports by 7 percent. Thus, the trade deficit of the oil-importing countries was reduced from $7,700 million in 1980 to about $4,000 million in 1981; this reduction was due mainly to Brazil's improved performance."
1982,"Low or negative economic growth makes the task of national economic management especially difficult. A rapidly growing population, increasingly concentrated in the urban centers, expects to be provided with basic social services even if revenues from the public sector do not rise in real terms. The region's labor force continues to grow and to require new jobs.With mounting unemployment and declining personal incomes, social and political tensions are heightened, and politically acceptable trade-offs are more difficult to find. The fight against inflation, in particular, becomes extremely difficult to pursue in these circumstances."
1982,"In calendar 1981, inflation accelerated to nearly 60 percent for the region as a whole (weighted by the population of each country); it exceeded 100 percent in Argentina and remained near that level in Brazil in spite of the reductions in GDP in both countries. In contrast, Chile succeeded in bringing about a drastic reduction in inflation in 1981 (at about 10 percent, down from 39 percent in 1979 and 31 percent in 1980) through a combination of open-trade policy, balanced public finances, and a fixed exchange rate. Exchange-rate management was a serious challenge for policy makers in several countries; periods of overvaluation were followed by massive devaluations in four countries in the region during fiscal 1981: Argentina, Bolivia, Costa Rica, and Mexico."
1982,"The Latin American Free Trade Association (ALALC) was created in 1960 and included Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Through reduction of tariffs and elimination of trade restrictions on selected products, intra-zonal trade expanded from under 8 percent of the countries' total trade to about 13 percent by 1978. More than one-half of this trade was in manufactures, of which some were of relatively advanced technology."
1982,"Ecuador, and Peru. Subsequently, Venezuela joined the group and Chile withdrew. The Andean Group's operations are complemented by the Andean Development Corporation, created in 1968 to provide financing for preinvestment studies, technical assistance, and investment projects aimed at fostering Andean integration. The impetus to the group's formulation was the desire to proceed with integration more rapidly than was possible under ALALC. The principal Andean Group policies—internal trade liberalization behind a fairly high common external tariff, complemented by specific allocation among countries of certain industrial projects, and a common set of rules for the treatment of foreign capital—gave a decided import-substitution bias to the original formulation. Although intragroup trade has grown rapidly, it remains a small share of each country's imports and exports. Recent changes indicate that the members of the Andean Group are attempting to remove some of the import-substitution bias, allow greater play to market forces, and reduce discrimination against the primary sectors and exports. If successful, such changes should promote faster, more efficient, and more equitable growth."
1982,"The Central American Common Market (CACM), which was established in 1960 and included Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, built upon various bilateral and multilateral arrangements that had been developed among those countries during the 1950s. (Honduras formally withdrew from the CACM in 1969, but has continued to participate in policy discussions, technical work, and trade through ad hoc arrangements and bilateral agreements.) This integration movement was characterized by free trade among the member countries (primarily for manufactured products), combined"
1982,"As part of the attempt to lift the constraints imposed by limited market sizes, some efforts were made by the medium-sized and smaller countries to create regional groupings that put special emphasis on trade in manufactures. These systems, however, had limited successes."
1982,"The CACM countries experienced considerable economic growth through the mid-1970s; expansion in the industrial sector made a major contribution to rising incomes and employment. Impressive growth in intracountry trade in manufactures was an important factor in that sector's development. Late in the 1960s, however, problems began to emerge. Some were of a technical nature, relating to the effects of liberalized trade on the fiscal situation of individual countries. Political rivalries also intruded. A further setback occurred after the first oil-price shock in 1973 and the subsequent world economic recession. After 1976, there was some recovery in economic activity in the countries and further expansion of trade among members through 1980. In 1981, however, the growing macroeconomic difficulties of some of the countries, partly reflecting the stagnation in world demand for the basic products on which the region continues to depend for foreign-exchange earnings, as well as the severe internal political strife experienced in three countries, resulted, for the first time, in a major contraction in intraregional trade."
1982,"Federation in 1958—was dropped when two of the Federation's major member countries, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, achieved independence in 1962. The idea of regional economic association was revived in the mid-1960s and culminated in 1968 in the formation of the Caribbean Free Trade Association (CARIFTA). Within this free-trade area, the seven islands of the Eastern Caribbean formed the East Caribbean Common Market (ECCM). In 1970, the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) was established and in October 1972, CARIFTA-member countries decided to strengthen the integration movement still further by forming a Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM)."
1982,"CARICOM seeks to deepen regional integration and includes such measures as the establishment of a common external tariff, a harmonized system of fiscal incentives for industry, and taxation agreements. It calls for coordination of national development planning, rationalization of agriculture, joint development of regional natural resources, and cooperation in other areas including health, education, culture, transport, and the harmonization of foreign policy. Progress toward achieving CARICOM's goals, however, has been slow, owing mainly to the political differences prevailing in the region, to the effects of recent economic difficulties, and to the problems inherent in a system whose members are both small and widely dispersed geographically. Most progress has been made in the field of regional trade—its share in total trade increased from 6 percent in 1967 to 9 percent in 1975—but this has slowed in recent years. The degree of success of this integration movement should be judged, however, not only by the growth in regional trade, but also by the success in cooperation in other fields."

Cofinancing ($2.3 million) is being provided by the UNDP. Total cost: $50.9 million."

1982,"investment in the developing countries. An important element of these flows, particularly for the low-income countries, is the net flows of official development assistance (ODA)—that is, grants and concessional loans. ODA from members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC)9 of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), at $25.5 billion, decreased by 4 percent in real terms and by about 6 percent in nominal terms in 1981. That figure amounted to 0.35 percent of their combined GNP, compared with 0.38 percent in 1980 and 0.35 percent in 1979. However, five countries provided more than 0.7 percent of their GNP in the form of ODA: Denmark. France, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden.

The Conference recommended to the UN General Assembly the establishment of an intergovernmental body to guide and monitor a program of action for the development of new and renewable sources of energy; recommendations would be submitted to the General Assembly through the Economic and Social Council for implementing the program. The Conference also agreed on a system for coordinating action by UN organs and intergovernmental organizations that are involved in the development of new and renewable sources of energy under the Director General for Development and International Economic Cooperation.

This project was based on the findings of the first phase of a comprehensive transport survey which the Bank had helped finance, and is intended to be the first of a series of major highway projects in Brazil for which the Bank will provide funds. Other large projects approved during the year included highway loans to Yugoslavia and Argentina, a railway loan to China, and an IDA credit of $28 million to Indonesia for roads; the Indonesian project covers the rehabilitation of about 2,000 miles of roads, the improvement of maintenance services in 20 provinces, and training and other technical assistance."

The proper coordination of road and rail transport is also a major concern of the Bank when making railway loans, such as the loans made to China, Colombia, Guinea, Pakistan and Tunisia during the year."
1969,"All Bank Group financing must be for high-priority productive projects; much of it is designed to remove constraints on economic development by making possible a higher degree of utilization of existing factors of production. This was the case with a number of the Bank's power loans during the year—for example, those to Brazil, China, Malaysia and Sierra Leone, all of which will provide badly needed new capacity to help relieve present or expected shortfalls of electricity supplies to these countries' expanding industrial and commercial sectors. Other loans will maximize the benefits obtainable from earlier power projects, for instance a loan to Colombia that will integrate into a single system the operation of four separate generating authorities and thereby obtain significant economies of scale."

Strenuous efforts are also being made in education, although the rapid growth in the number of children of school age makes it almost impossible for the education authorities to keep pace with demand. While some growth of industry has also taken place, only a few countries—the Republic of China, Korea, Iran, Mexico—have made major advances in industrial output. Agriculture remains the main occupation in most developing countries, and what happens in this sector largely influences overall rates of economic growth. Just as drought in many parts of Asia and Africa resulted in the stagnation or decline of agricultural production in 1964/65 and 1965/66, generally better weather in 1967/68, and to some extent in 1968/69 contributed to the large grain crops in these years. The rice crop indevelop'ng countries was particularly good in 1967/68, as was the wheat crop in 1968/69. With 1957-59 - 100, the index of per capita agricultural production In the developing countries was 102 in 1967 and 1968, as against only 97 in 1966; in South Asia it was 104 in 1968, as against 89 in 1966.

In the years 1960-68, the aggregate exports of developing countries rose by almost 6% a year; the rates of growth in fuels, manufactures and metals have been higher than the average. Accordingly, the rather limited number of countries that depend mainly on petroleum exports and on exports of manufactured items have had higher export growth rates since 1960. Apart from petroleum producing countries (among which Libya continues to register the most remarkable gains), Korea, Israel, Pakistan, Mexico and the Republic of China have experienced relatively large gains in exports. India's exports, which remained rather stagnant for some years, increased by 8% in 1968 to a level of $1,750 miilion; the increase was especially large for non-traditional, manufactured and semi-manufactured items. Latin American exports grew little in 1967 and 1968: the exports of Argentina and Chile declined, while Brazil's exports rose in 1968 by about 15% to $1,900 million. The availability of preferential trade advantages in some markets, and policies designed to promote exports, including the establishment of realistic exchange rates, the improvement of quality and the reduction of costs, are among the factors which contributed to the relatively large expansion of some developing countries' exports."

The decisions of the Executive Directors and the staff report were transmitted to the Governors."
1969,"Apart from special studies of this kind, and the economic analysis it undertakes in connection with individual projects or the problems of particular member countries, an important part of the Bank's economic work takes the form of other general studies relevant either to economic development as a whole or the Bank's own work. These may include the examination of economic problems of whole sectors of activity, of major commodities, of international trade, or of methodological questions associated with the Bank's activities. In addition the Bank maintains, in cooperation with OECD and the regional development banks, a comprehensive international reporting system on the external debt of developing countries."
1969,TRENDS IN GROWTH AND TRADE
1969,"High levels of investment, output and trade, and high and rising interest rates, continued to characterize the industrialized world during 1968 and the first half of 1969. Concern over their balance of payments situation remained a major factor in a number of developed countries' economic policymaking in 1969 as in 1968. In addition, the international monetary situation, with intermittent agitation in the currency and gold markets, has required close attention. The net flow of capital to developing countries has not increased in step witn the growth of the national product of the developed countries. And this has happened precisely at a time when development assistance on an expanded scale would enable many developing countries to consolidate the gains they have made in recent years, and could help others to initiate a genuine development effort."
1969,"Both the successes and failures of the developing countries are reflected in the world trade figures of recent years. Total world trade expansion in the 1960s has been substantial and uninterrupted, averaging nearly 8.5% per annum. Including the trade of the centrally planned economies, total world exports in 1968 may have amounted to $238 billion. The developing countries have also increased their trade, but their share in the total is relatively small and declining, particularly"
1969,"on a per capita basis, while that of the developed countries is large and rising. The broad trends in export trade, according to UN statistics, are indicated below:"
1969,"World exports, excluding the trade of the centrally-planned economies, amounted to $211 billion in 1968, up by 11 % from the 1967 total; the growth rate was almost double that recorded in 1967. Unusually strong import demand in the United States and Germany accounted for about 40% of the increase in world exports in 1968. The share of the developing countries in this, at $43.4 billion, was 20%, compared with 21% in 1967, 22% in 1960, 27% in 1953 and 30% in 1948. The exports of the industrialized countries grew by 12% in 1968, and those of developing countries by almost 8%."
1969,"Well over two-thirds of the total exports of the developing countries generally go to North America, Western Europe and Japan. Therefore, the growth of these economies and changes in the level of their demand for imports has a material bearing on the trade prospects of the developing countries. The exports of developing countries rose by 8% in 1968, as against 3.9% in 1967; the OECD countries imported 13% more from them in 1968, as against only 4% more in"
1969,1967. Trade among the developing countries themselves increased by only 3% in 1967.
1969,"The outlook for world exports in 1969 is for a projected increase of about 8%. Although total exports of industrial countries were about 15% higher in the first quarter of 1969 than in the corresponding period of 1968, a deceleration in the expansion of world trade is expected in 1969 compared to"

In the years 1960-68, the aggregate exports of developing countries rose by almost 6% a year; the rates of growth in fuels, manufactures and metals have been higher than the average.

The availability of preferential trade advantages in some markets, and policies designed to promote exports, including the establishment of realistic exchange rates, the improvement of quality and the reduction of costs, are among the factors which contributed to the relatively large expansion of some developing countries' exports."
1969,"iccounted for almost one-third of world exports as a whole. Developing countries' exports have not risen proportionately vith the growth in world trade, partly at least because they ;onsist overwhelmingly of primary products, many of them vith relatively sluggish growth trends. Total exports of primary products have tended to expand at a much slower rate than exports of manufactured items, in value as well as volume, is may be seen from the following UN data:"
1969,"been subject to particularly wide price fluctuations, which have themselves sometimes contributed to adverse longer-term price trends. Demand for most primary products is growing relatively slowly as a result of both technological developments and changes in consumer spending patterns. Moreover, world trade in primary products, and particularly in agricultural products, has been held back by the protection given by industrial countries to their own"
1969,"from certain other commodities when export volume has increased. On the demand side, demand for foodstuffs in the high-income countries generally rises only at a modest pace, even when incomes rise at 4-5% a year, while the demand for several industrial raw materials, such as jute, rubber, cotton and wool, is subject to competition from synthetics— a trend encouraged in certain periods by the uncertainty of supplies of some important raw materials, and the rather wide fluctuations in their prices. Furthermore, with technological progress, there is a tendency toward greater economy in the use of materials. While the trends in world trade and the nature of demand and supply conditions affect developing countries generally, some countries depend on one or two primary commodity exports for a major part of their export earnings and are particularly exposed to volatility in their export earnings."
1969,"Commodity price trends in part explain the trends in the trade of developing countries; they are relevant to an under standing of the commodity problem and of the ways anc means of dealing with the problem. In considering expor and import prices in international trade or the prices o primary commodities or manufactures, no single index car be conclusive; available indices differ in their coverage o commodities, and in the weights and price quotations the; use. The inclusion or exclusion of petroleum and the weight: to such individual commodities affect the degree of variatior and the trend indicated by the index numbers.

1969,"The trends in commodity prices and in the export earnings of developing countries are of particular concern, because countries' economic development may be significantly affected by fluctuations in the stability and growth of their foreign exchange earnings. Efforts have therefore been made to deal with particular commodity problems through international commodity agreements, but such agreements have proved possible only in a few cases, and sometimes for limited objectives only. There has been equally limited progress in the removal of tariff and non-tariff obstacles to trade in these commodities. Basically, the stabilization of commodity prices requires improvement of the balance be-"
1969,"tween world production and demand. Well developed commodity arrangements also have a role to play in this process. In the longer run, the solution of the export trade problem of developing countries will have to involve diversification of production and exports. Other measures are also needed. One such measure is to encourage systematic research on new uses for some commodities, and on techniques of cost reduction. This may to some extent offset such effects of technological progress as the creation of new substitutes and economizing in raw materials on the part of industry. There is scope for greater effort and finance in this field."
1969,"No panacea or simple, single solution to this complex problem exists. It is greatly exacerbated by developing countries' low level of economic development; improvements in the situation can only result from sustained economic growth, carrying with it expansion and diversification of their export trade. This in turn, however, requires measures to correct the structural imbalances in countries' economies, to secure diversified production, and to improve productive efficiency. Part of the diversification effort may occur in the agricultural sphere itself, and be aimed especially at raising food output in developing countries; but diversification should also include industrialization efforts."
1969,"The stabil'zation of commodity prices and increased access to the markets of industrial countries through commodity arrangements represent the trade approach for influencing the foreign exchange receipts of developing countries. By reducing the amplitude of price fluctuations and by seeking to deal with the slow growth of demand for primary commodities, such arrangements aim at improving the level and trend of export earnings. Commodity arrangements take different forms, varying almost from case to case. Buffer stock arrangements have in recent years attracted particular attention from the developing countries as a means of reducing the instability of prices of primary products. A buffer stock, as"

In the Mediterranean area, Greece, Israel, Yugoslavia, Portugal, and Spain together expanded exports of merchandise by almost 12% per year between 1960 and 1966, and even in 1967 managed to increase them by 9%. These eight countries have two things in common: their merchandise exports consist of a relatively high percentage of manufactures and they have pursued policies explicitly designed to expand exports."

Some of these countries are in early stages of development and have not yet assumed debt service payments on a large scale. Others have received external assistance largely in the form of grants rather than loans. In several developing countries, rapid export growth has prevented a sharp increase in the debt service ratio, despite a rapid increase in debt service payments. Some of these countries (including Iran and Venezuela, as well as Zambia and Chile in the last two years) have benefited from favorable markets for petroleum or minerals. Certain other countries (including the Republic of China, Korea, Israel and Mexico) have pursued policies conducive to rapid export growth.

1968,"Trade and EconqmicGrowth: The economic progress achieved by developing countries depends not only on their overseas earnings from commodities but also on their balance of payments position as a whole. This in turn is significantly affected by the growth of their foreign trade, particularly with the developed nations. A number of studies dealing with developing countries' external trade in general, and some of the factors determining its growth, have been completed in the year under review. ""The Export Experience of Developing Countries"", an analysis of growth patterns in this field between 1950 and 1963, was published in the series of World Bank Staff Occasional Papers in November 1967."
1968,"Another study completed during the year, at the request of UNCTAD and presented to the second session of UNCTAD in New Delhi in February-March 1968, examined the impact of industrial countries' tariffs on developing countries' fabricated exports to them and assessed the possible repercussions of the so-called Kennedy Round of tariff reductions negotiated in 1967 on this sector of developing countries' trade."
1968,"A study produced in 1965/66 by the Bank's staff at the request of the first session of UNCTAD, on ""Supplementary Financial Measures"", was considered at the New Delhi meeting. Under the scheme put forward in the study, supplementary finance would be provided to support development programs that would otherwise be disrupted by the failure of export earnings to come up to reasonable expectations. The Intergovernmental Working Group set up earlier by UNCTAD to examine the study is to be expanded and will discuss further various unresolved issues and report to the UN Trade and Development Board."
1968,"art Two of the Annual Report is de-1 voted to a short outline of the chief trends in developing countries. While major developments in regard to economic growth and external trade are briefly described, the main focus of this part of the Report is on the external financing aspects of development. Sales of external bonds of developing countries and international development institutions are discussed within the broader context of international capital markets. The Report this year contains a special section on recent experience and prospects of agricultural development and a brief discussion of problems arising in a number of developing countries as a result of rapid growth in population. (Tables referred to in the text will be found in the Statistical Annex, beginning page 48.)"
1968,"The world economy in 1967 was characterized by a considerable slowdown in overall growth combined with severe strains in the balance of payments and international monetary system. This deceleration in growth began in mid-1966 and continued during 1967 both in the United States and in a number of European countries, such as the Federal Republic of Germany, France and the United Kingdom. The aggregate real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of industrialized countries increased by about 2.5% in 1967, compared to an average of about 5% per annum from 1960 to 1966. World trade increased by approximately 5% at current prices,"
1968,"marking a slowdown from the annual rate of expansion of over 8% between 1960 and 1966. The trade deceleration in the industrialized countries had adverse effects on export earnings of developing countries. The overall flow of development assistance continued to fall short of accepted targets, as a result of either balance of payments deficits or budgetary problems in some of the major aid-providing countries. Preliminary estimates for the first half of 1968 indicate an increase in the growth rate of GDP, particularly in the United States and also in some European countries, which could lead to renewed expansion in exports of developing countries."
1968,"The slowdown in trade expansion, as well as the basic stability in the level of aid commitments, formed the background to the second session of UNCTAD which took place in New Delhi in early 1968. Even before the Conference began, it was agreed by the in-"
1968,"Export earnings of developing countries as a group increased in 1967 by about 3.5%, compared to an average growth of 6.5% during the period 19601966 (Table 5). If exports of major petroleum producing countries and the developing countries of Southern Europe are excluded, the increase in 1967 amounted to only about $200 million, a fraction of 1%. This stagnation in export earnings was in part a result of the slow economic growth in industrialized countries, which affected their import demand and reduced the average price level of primary products. Developing countries in all regions were affected by the slow growth of world trade in 1967, although in varying degrees; South Asia and Latin America actually experienced a small absolute reduction in export earnings. Rapid supply expansion in some commodities contributed to the decline in average prices."
1968,"Prices of some commodities may rise as world economic activity and trade grow at a faster rate than in 1967. But the continuation of the general erosion of coffee prices, and to a lesser extent tin, is a matter of concern, especially as coffee and tin are two commodities for which international agreements designed to stabilize prices have been in effect for some time. The successful renewal of the International Coffee Agreement in 1968 provides hope that price stability for coffee, a commodity accounting for about one-half of the export earnings of eight developing countries, can be maintained. The International Tin Agreement is expected to be able to prevent further significant deterioration in prices from the mid-"

Reductions granted by industrialized countries on the manufactured exports of developing countries were considerably smaller than the concessions made to other industrialized countries. The prospective expansion of manufactured exports from developing to industrialized countries directly attributed to the Kennedy Round tariff reductions has been estimated at $200 millon2 per year, or about 16% of present manufactured exports of developing countries. Even this small increase is not likely to materialize, and may even be reduced by almost one-half, if quotas under the long-term Cotton Textiles Arrangement as well as quantitative restrictions on"
1968,"A World Bank staff study3 on the export experience of 29 developing countries suggests that variations in export growth are due to a combination of differences in economic policies and in trade positions of countries. The study makes a distinction between exports of ""major"" commodities, which are mostly primary commodities traded on well-organized international markets, and ""minor"" exports, which comprise a large group of manufactured and agricultural products traded on a relatively smaller scale. Changes in exports over the period studied, 1950-63, appeared to be associated with countries' shares in the markets of major commodities in the initial years; countries with small shares in the markets tended to fare better than those with large shares. Exports which comprised a small share of total exports tended to experience relatively favorable growth and, in this"
1968,"respect, behaved like ""minor"" exports which expanded considerably faster than ""major"" exports. A distinction is also made in the study between countries with outward orientation in their economic policies, as against those with inward orientation emphasizing production for domestic markets. The majority of countries with small domestic markets and small shares in world exports of a particular commodity have pursued policies that are predominantly outward oriented. These countries have managed to maintain competitive price levels through fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies, and have achieved a considerable increase in exports. In contrast, countries with relatively large domestic markets and important external trade positions have tended to pursue inward oriented policies. For both ""minor"" and ""major"" exports, the greatest improvement was achieved by countries which had small external market positions and a policy of outward orientation."
1968,"The larger grain crops will accentuate the needs for storage and handling facilities to prevent large-scale damage and losses from insects and rodents and from exposure to heat and moisture. Considerable investments will be required for storage, processing and marketing facilities as well as farm-to-market roads. Moreover, as more developing countries benefit from the new technology there is likely to be a reduced need for food aid and eventually a reversal of present trade patterns for food grains. This will require a rethinking of current policies in developed as well as developing countries, with a possible view to shifting production resources from food grains into feed grain and livestock production, in order to meet a growing demand for proteins."

The International Finance Corporation is expected to be more active in financing the production and distribution of fertilizers, insecticides and other important agricultural inputs. High priority must also be given to the financing of processing, storage and marketing facilities for the increased output which can be expected. Investments in farm-to-market roads as well as basic investments in roads, railways and ports will need to be increased to handle the higher volume of trade generated by increased production."
1968,"The expanded system operated jointly by the Bank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) for reporting on statistics of loans and grants by developed to developing countries became operational during the year.

1954,"was for most of the free world a period of growing prosperity. It marked a further stage in the economic expansion which has taken place with little interruption since the end of the Second World War. Although local shortages remained, total food production more than kept pace with population growth; industrial production continued to increase both in amount and in diversity. The volume of international trade reached a new high level, more than 50% above that of the immediate prewar years. A number of countries of Europe were in a better position to extend credit abroad, and there were other signs that the international flow of long-term private capital was beginning to gain momentum."
1954,"The story of the year was not, however, one of steady progress everywhere. In a few countries inflation increased, bringing serious balance of payments difficulties. Although commodity prices were generally stable, the fall in coffee, rice, wool and certain other prices had adverse effects on the terms of trade and balance of payments of some exporting countries, and required adjustments in internal consumption and investment."

This sum will cover the cost of some of the imports needed for a transport expansion program to be carried out in Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika, at a cost equivalent to about $100 million, over the four-year period 1954-57. The program will enable the transport system to meet the heavy demands already imposed by the growth of the import and export trade on which the territories heavily depend."

It has been built principally on the production of rubber and tin for export, on a large entrepot trade, on the production of food mostly for local consumption, and a variety of small industries. For the Federation, the mission placed highest priority on the replanting of rubber areas with high-yielding varieties to enable the rubber industry to compete with synthetic rubber and maintain its present place of paramount importance in the economy. The mission also recommended that surveys be undertaken to increase knowledge of Malaya's agricultural potential. The mission recognized the importance of increasing rice production, but urged that more attention be given to the relative economic advantages of other crops. Special emphasis, it believed, should be placed on the possibilities of extending oil palm, cocoa and coconut cultivation."

1983,"A few other countries (such as Jordan and Turkey), which have adopted more flexible economic policies, also achieved rates of growth well above the average for developing countries. Low-income countries in Asia maintained respectable growth rates, as India's and China's large domestic markets provided some insulation from the recession. India, however, suffered from a poor monsoon, which reduced agricultural production and growth in exports. Most alarming was the continued economic stagnation in low-income Africa, where GDP has declined steadily in per capita terms since the early 1970s."
1983,"The export volumes of low-income Asian countries increased significantly in 1982. India's exports increased by about 5 percent, and China appears to have maintained its program of expanding exports, albeit at a reduced rate. Still, declines in commodity prices meant that the dollar value of exports from low-income Asia were more than 3 percent below the 1981 level. Growth in the volume of exports from low-income African countries was close to zero, while price declines reduced exports in current prices to more than 14 percent below their 1980 level."

1983,"The intent of the realignment is to give greater weight to the following two objectives: improvement in the Bank's capacity to give policy advice to member countries and further development of local research capacity in member countries. In support of the latter, the Bank's criteria for selecting research projects were altered to encourage more collaborative projects involving researchers and institutions in developing countries to the maximum extent possible. Indications are that such personnel and institutions will be increasingly tapped for the conceptualization, execution, and evaluation of a larger share of the research portfolio. For example, funding for recently approved projects on the determinants of fertility in Bangladesh, tax systems in Mexico and Pakistan, and public enterprises in China was contingent upon involvement with on-site collaborators from the countries under study."
1983,"The developing countries of the East Asia and Pacific region—with the exception of China— have experienced the full force of the world recession. Their economic prospects have been dominated by the poor performance of the world economy, and their economic policies have been preoccupied with the search for appropriate means to deal with the changing economic situation. After a decade of high growth, accompanied by moderately high inflation, low and often negative real interest rates, and a plentiful supply of private capital from the international banking system, fiscal 1983 was characterized by low growth, falling inflation, high and positive real interest rates, and a reduction in the flow of overseas capital. The reduction was, in part, due to some hesitancy on the part of the world banking system to extend further credit to countries perceived to have relatively large debt burdens."
1983,"in the region, China, continues to grow, despite the recession, while making internal adjustments in its economic system. Two major net oil-exporting countries, Indonesia and Malaysia, have had to adjust to lower world oil prices and weaker demand. Both face substantial internal adjustments at both the macro and the micro levels. Another group of countries affected by the recession consists of the three newly industrializing countries, the Republic of Korea, Thailand, and the Philippines. These three countries were already under pressure from the oil-price increases of 1979-80 and from the high (and variable) interest rates of 1980-81. While interest rates began to come down in mid-1982, oil prices remained high until 1983. Other aspects of the world recession, such as falling commodity prices, declining export markets, and rising protectionism have hit these countries hard. All three have programs of structural adjustment, which are being supported by IBRD loans. The remaining"
1983,China: The Least Affected
1983,"China's experience during the past year has differed markedly from the other countries of the region. Since 1979, Chinese economic policy has had two main objectives: to adjust the structure of production and expenditure in such a way as to raise the share of consumption in national income and to reform the system of economic management so as to increase the efficiency of production and investment. Though neither objective has proved easy to attain, this strategy, on balance, has had rather good results."
1983,"The investment cuts reduced imports of equipment: they also depressed output from heavy industry, which lowered domestic energy-consumption and enabled energy exports to be maintained. China's manufactured exports continued their expansion despite the world recession. Expansion was restrained, however, by an increasing number of protectionist barriers abroad."
1983,"China is thus well placed to resume a more normal level of investment, within the framework of the recently published sixth five-year plan. Yet. the requirements for external finance, especially concessional aid to help finance its development and modernization programs, will increase substantially during the remainder of the decade. New investment will emphasize energy production and transport infrastructure, two major constraints facing the economy: this emphasis is to be complemented by an extensive investment program to modernize the country's huge but technologically backward industrial sector.

1983,"Movements in exchange rates in 1982 complicated economic management in industrial countries. The dollar continued its strong appreciation against other currencies; a trade-weighted index of the dollar exchange rate adjusted for inflation differentials increased by almost 20 percent over the 1981 average. The resulting decline in US import prices helped to moderate inflation in that country, while the increase in the foreign-currency price of US exports made them less competitive in world markets and contributed to deepening the recession in the US. Other countries may have been forced to pursue policies more contractionary than they otherwise would have been in view of the inflationary impact of their depreciating currencies. The benefit to Europe and Japan from the gain in competitiveness of their exports was vitiated somewhat by the extremely low level of economic activity in the United States and pressures for restrictions on imports."
1983,"Growth in the oil-importing developing countries decreased slightly from the already poor performance in 1981. The GDP of Latin American oil-importing countries declined by 3.3 percent in per capita terms, following a 4.5 percent decline in 1981. Most other oil-importing countries achieved little improvement or actual declines in per capita income. The major exceptions were East Asian countries, which achieved high rates of growth compared with most other countries. Their more flexible economies enabled them to cope better with the adverse international environment—despite their dependence on trade. Even these countries, however, saw their growth reduced in 1982 well below its historical trend, as a result of debt problems and reduced demand for their manufactured exports."
1983,"Oil prices. The market for oil has been subject to considerable uncertainty over the past year. The average price of internationally traded oil declined by 4 percent in 1982 owing to increased supply and reduced demand, reflecting the impact of the higher relative price of oil since 1973 and short-term cyclical factors. From 1973 to 1981, the dollar price of oil increased significantly relative to the average prices of manufactured goods and other primary commodities. This increase in its relative price led to efforts to reduce the consumption of petroleum products and to find substitute energy sources."
1983,"Terms of trade. The major factors affecting developing countries' terms of trade were lower oil prices, severe falls in nonoil-commodity prices, and stability in the prices of manufactures. Weakness in the price of oil meant that oil-exporting countries experienced a worsening in their terms of trade in 1982, although this was moderated by some decline in the prices of their imports in dollar terms. The benefit to the oil importers of weak oil prices was more than cancelled by the loss owing to the plunge in nonoil-commodity prices, and their terms of trade fell significantly below the 1980 level. The terms-of-trade loss of oil-importing countries in 1982 was due largely to cyclical factors, but it was superimposed on a continued erosion in their terms of trade, which have dropped by over one-fifth since 1970. Low-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa have been particularly affected, as they rely heavily on nonoil-commodity exports, the prices of which fell sharply in the 1970s relative to both manufactures and oil. These countries' terms of trade have declined by about 30 percent since 1970. Preliminary data indicate that oil-importing countries' terms of trade may have begun to improve, as commodity prices have increased since late 1982 and oil prices have fallen. The terms of trade of oil-exporting countries have no doubt fallen."
1983,World Trade
1983,"While the recession-caused reduction in demand probably accounts for the major share in the recent reduction in the volume of developing countries' exports, restrictions on imports of various kinds also played a role. Since the conclusion of the Multilateral Trade Negotiations in 1979, the drive towards trade liberalization has slowed considerably. Industrial countries have taken protectionist actions in a number of sectors, particularly automobiles, steel, textiles, and agriculture. Measures have included the imposition of so-called ""voluntary restraints"" on some countries' exports, agreements such as the Multifibre Arrangement, designed to limit import penetration in industrial-country markets, and bureaucratic delays in granting import licences. Many of these actions (with the important exception of the Multifibre Arrangement) affect other industrial countries more than developing countries. On the other hand, the incidence of nontariff barriers and the tariffs agreed upon at the Multilateral Trade Negotiations in 1979 are both relatively higher than the average on products exported by developing countries. There is a considerable concern that renewed protectionist activity could hinder developing-country exports, just when a recovery in export receipts is essential to meet debt-service payments and return to reasonable growth rates."
1983,"In the 1970s, trade among developing countries increased more rapidly than total trade. As a result, some observers believed that growth in this trade would partially compensate for reductions in demand from industrial countries during the current recession. Preliminary indications do not bear out this belief. In 1981, developing countries' exports to other developing countries declined at about the same rate as their exports to the world. In 1982, as more developing countries instituted controls on imports and restraints on internal demand, there is some evidence that trade among developing countries may have contracted more than total exports. For example, Brazil's exports, in current terms, to industrial countries declined by over 3 percent in 1982.' By comparison, Brazil's exports to oil-importing developing countries dropped by about 19 percent."
1983,"In contrast with 1981, when the current-account deficit of both oil importers and oil exporters increased, in 1982, the oil importers reduced their deficit by $11 billion; the deficit of the oil-exporting countries, on the other hand, increased by $11 billion over 1981. However, the contractionary impact of the external sector was greater on the developing countries than indicated by movements in the current-account deficit. For developing countries as a whole, little change in the deficit in 1982 was accompanied by an increase in their interest payments, while other components of their service income remained roughly the same. Many developing countries, therefore, had to reduce their trade balance by an amount greater than the reduction in their current-account deficit. Since export receipts fell in 1982, purchases of imports had to be compressed even further. Table 6 shows various components of the external accounts of developing countries."
1983,"interest rates. The resource balance was about $15 billion less than in 1981. Export receipts declined by about $ 10 billion, so imports dropped by almost $25 billion. Oil-exporting countries were not forced into an adjustment as severe as that of the oil importers. Their current-account and net trade deficits increased somewhat in 1982, and the decline in their export receipts was slight .These countries, therefore, were able to increase their imports somewhat, but at a slower rate than in recent years."
1983,"A number of countries were forced to institute severely contractionary policies, including import controls, to limit their current-account deficits. In Nigeria, for example, the government responded to the deterioration in oil revenues and budget finances by increasing import restrictions, lowering the value of the naira, and placing limits on borrowing by the individual states. Imports were reduced by over 30 percent in the last nine months of 1982, and GNP declined by almost 2 percent. Brazil instituted severely contractionary policies to control imports and limit the increase in its outstanding debt. Restrictive measures included a sharp increase in reserve requirements to reduce expansion of domestic credit, a cut in dollar allowances for travel abroad, a freeze in government investment (which represents a decline in real terms), and import restrictions. In early 1983, the cruzeiro was devalued by 30 percent. As a result of these measures, Brazil achieved a trade surplus of some S2 billion in 1982 despite the 13 percent drop in export receipts, while GNP was flat after the decline of 3.5 percent the year before. Mexico announced a series of policy measures to limit its current-account deficit, including a severe devaluation of the peso, exchange controls to reduce capital flight, an increase in the value-added tax, and a sharp cut in the deficit of the public sector. GDP increased by"
1983,"Restrictive policies and the resulting declines in imports severely reduced growth in developing countries. But for the intervention of the IMF, the reduction in imports could have been even greater. This reduction of imports by developing countries also helped to lower exports of industrial countries. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) estimated that the decline in volume of exports by industrial countries was largely the result of reduced demand by developing countries, and the OECD estimated that the reduction in non-OECD imports may have reduced growth in GNP of its members by about half a percentage point. The world dealt with the worst recession since the Second World War by collectively reducing demand."
1983,"The 1980-82 recession, characterized by extremely high real interest rates, stagnation in world trade, and a sharp fall in commodity prices, seriously complicated developing countries' management of their external debt. The fall in export receipts, coupled with the increase in interest payments, made it very difficult for a number of countries to maintain their debt-service payments. The ratio of debt service to export receipts (including services) for all developing countries increased from 13.6 percent in 1980 to"
1983,"It is possible that debt levels of these countries would not have been considered excessive in the conditions existing during the latter half of the 1970s, when real interest rates were low and export volumes and prices were increasing. Today, however, the debt of a number of countries is less easily manageable in light of unprecedented real interest rates, falling commodity prices, and reduced demand for developing countries' exports. Assuming an intelligent response to current problems, it is likely that the crisis can be weathered without serious disruption to the international financial system. Unfortunately, the measures taken by many developing countries to restrain their borrowing have been, and will continue to be, extremely painful. Austerity programs and attempts to achieve trade surpluses are exacting a heavy toll. Just as seriously, in some countries, reductions in public expenditures have particularly affected investment projects, which could have adverse consequences for future living standards. Private investment has also declined sharply, in response to reduced demand, uncertain prospects, and high interest rates. Because reduced investment lowers the potential growth of the economy, it may take many years for countries, particularly those in Latin America, to recover from their current problems. The difficulties in the short term can be ameliorated, to a degree, through increased efficiency in the use of human and material resources. In the particular case of Latin American countries, as reported on page 100. ""Over the long term, [they] are well positioned to resume strong growth."""
1983,"Despite the favorable long-term prospects of developing countries and the high degree of international cooperation that has been achieved notwithstanding, changes in the global economic environment are essential before current debt problems can be overcome. First and foremost, a higher rate of recovery of the industrial countries would help increase exports of developing countries. A high rate of growth in industrial countries would translate into a growth in the exports of developing countries only if protectionist pressures are not allowed to cause new barriers against trade to be erected. While more difficult to achieve, a reduction in current levels of protection would also, of course, facilitate expansion of developing-country exports. At the same time, a decline in the level of interest rates and an increase in the level of ODA will help the developing countries to recover from the depths of the current recession. All this was recognized by the leaders of the seven industrial countries who met in Williamsburg. Virginia, in May 1983."
1983,"issues in a variety of fora. In meetings held between developed and developing countries and among the developing countries during the past fiscal year, attention was particularly focused on problems relating to financial flows, external debt, international trade, and commodities."
1983,"GATT ministerial meeting. In November 1982, eighty-eight countries were represented at the ministerial level at a meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Geneva. A joint declaration issued at the end of the meeting reaffirmed a basic commitment against protectionism and a renewed consensus in support of the GATT system. One of the undertakings agreed by the parties in drawing up their priorities for the 1980s was to ensure that trade policies and measures are consistent with GATT principles. The declaration dealt with specific areas, notably agriculture, where negotiations concerned the integration of agricultural trade in the GATT Multilateral Trading System. A further area of concern was the safeguard system to ensure efficiency and predictability in the application of the safeguard clause under the GATT to both importing and exporting countries."
1983,"At the Development Committee's April 1983 meeting in Washington, D.C, under the chairmanship of Ghulam Ishaq Khan. Minister of Finance, Commerce, and Economic Coordination of Pakistan, concern was expressed that the economic situation had remained difficult since the last meeting in September 1982. The Committee addressed the broad subject of the elements of global economic-recovery efforts, under the following items: financial flows from, and level of lending by, multilateral institutions and the implications for their capital base; the status and funding of IDA; the external-debt problems of developing countries; and the linkages between trade and the promotion of development. As for lending programs of multilateral institutions, the World Bank was invited to put forward proposals, with due regard to financial prudence, that would allow an expansion of the Bank's lending program. The management of the Bank was also requested to present a specific proposal to the Executive Directors for a Selective Capital Increase in line with the Eighth General Review of Quotas in the Fund by the time of the next Committee meeting in September 1983. The crucial importance of IDA in financing the development programs of low-income countries was reaffirmed. Note was taken of the critical situation facing the sixth replenishment of IDA, stretched out over four years with the resulting reduction in intended annual IDA commitments. With regard to the seventh replenishment of IDA, special needs for an expanded replenishment were noted. On external-debt problems, the need to maintain and increase financial flows to developing countries from official sources was emphasized. The linkages between trade and development were discussed by the Committee. In particular, the Committee called on governments to resist protectionist pressures. Both the Bank and the Fund were urged to collaborate with the GATT in keeping under review progress made in liberalizing the international-trade environment."
1983,"Nonaligned-movement summit. The Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Nonaligned Countries was held in New Delhi, India, in March 1983 under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India. More than 100 countries were represented. The Economic Declaration of the Conference reaffirmed the commitment of heads of state to the early launching of global negotiations. They called for a program of immediate measures in areas of crucial importance to developing countries—in food, energy development, financial flows. World Bank assistance, IMF balance-of-payments support, trade, and raw materials. In the field of monetary and financial issues and the transfer of resources, the Declaration held that the official development-assistance (ODA) target, set by the United Nations, of 0.7 percent of GNP. should be attained by 1985 and, within this context, that a target be met of 0.15 percent of GNP for ODA to the least-developed countries. A substantial expansion, both of the current lending program of the Bank, as well as in the seventh replenishment of IDA, was called for. On external debt, the heads of state urged the development of a multilateral framework for the restructuring of the debt burden of the developing countries. They also called for reform of the international monetary system and the convening of an international conference on money and finance for development."
1983,"Group of 77: Buenos Aires meeting. The fifth ministerial meeting of the Group of 77 convened in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in March 1983. The purpose of the meeting was to prepare positions on issues for presentation to the Trade and Development Board and for the June 1983 meeting of UNCTAD VI in Belgrade. Yugoslavia. The Declaration that ensued from the meeting called for a reactivation of the world economy and accelerated growth in the developing countries through global solutions. Ministers reiterated their commitment to the immediate launching of global negotiations, thus supporting the decision of the nonaligned summit at New Delhi. In the interrelated fields of commodities, trade, money, and finance and development, a Program of Immediate Measures was called for, including the establishment of the Common Fund, accelerated World Bank lending, a substantial increase in concessional assistance, the restructuring of the external debt of the developing countries, an immediate and substantial allocation of special drawing rights (SDRs), and an increase in IMF quotas."
1983,"reported that there were wide-ranging discussions on the state of the world economy and on the growing strains in the international financial system. Special action was called for to expand the lending operations of the World Bank to meet the increased needs of its member countries. Regarding the poorest countries. Commonwealth finance ministers gave strong support to a substantial increase in real terms in the replenishment of IDA. There was particular support for donor countries to provide bridging contributions for 1984 in order to avoid a decline in IDA lending activities in that year. Commonwealth finance ministers also expressed the view that to avoid a further deterioration in the world economy and to initiate a process of sustained recovery, the whole framework of international cooperation would need reform. The Commonwealth Secretariat was accordingly mandated to carry out a study of the international trade and payments system and. in particular, of the role of the international institutions. A Steering Group of experts is preparing a report for the September 1983 meeting of the Commonwealth finance ministers."
1983,"On the eve of the GATT Ministerial Meeting, the Commonwealth trade ministers met in Geneva, Switzerland. The meeting gave substantial support for the concept of a standstill on protectionist barriers. The Commonwealth Meeting on Trade followed a protracted Commonwealth study with a report by an expert group on protectionism, which was presented by the Commonwealth Secretariat in preparation for the GATT Ministerial Meeting."
1983,"UNCTAD VI. The Sixth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development took place in Belgrade. Yugoslavia, in June 1983. The focus was on the deteriorating world economic situation and its impact on development, with the integrating factors of international trade and commodities and financial and monetary issues."
1983,The two-day summit ended in agreement on a series of broad policies designed to nourish the worldwide economic recovery over the next several years. Agreement was reached that anti-inflation policies be continued and that there should be a rollback of recently imposed trade barriers.
1983,"4. Enhanced policy dialogue. On request, the Bank will help governments review investment programs, macroeconomic policies, trade and pricing policies, expand its assistance for debt management, and assist in evaluating changes in development priorities."
1983,"atory facility, which is relatively new, is designed to allow researchers scope for exploration of issues on the cutting edge of research, to enhance the research capacity of units within the operations complex of the Bank, to carry out some pilot analysis, and to visit member countries to negotiate collaborative arrangements for research. Also, in fiscal 1983, some twenty new or ongoing research projects involved the application of earlier research findings in new contexts in order to test their broadened applicability or to expedite and hasten the dissemination of results. The successful application of a research technique generally leads to its becoming part of the stock-in-trade of Bank analysts who no longer consider such an activity as research, but as part of operating procedures."
1983,"Until now, the program has tended to focus on issues and questions that pertain to sectors around which Bank lending has usually been organized. A revised orientation follows from the fact that many policy questions are relevant across sectors and that the units of economic analysis are not always confined to a single sector. In terms of the program's emerging priorities, issues are increasingly being identified in the areas of international trade and finance, public economics, household economics, and technology. These issues are important to countries in all regions of the world; however, in accordance with the Bank's special emphasis on Africa, major efforts are being made to address these issues in an African context. Research on issues related to energy and to structural adjustment also continue to merit special attention."
1983,"In the face of budgetary stringency as a result of the worldwide recession and related stagnation of world trade and retrenchment of commercial lending, member countries are seeking advice on the impact of alternative policies affecting growth and welfare. Analyzing the tradeoffs implicit in such choices has become an important part of the research program. In the past three years, the amount of research resources devoted to development policy and planning has risen from 14 percent to 23 percent of the budget. As part of that effort, computable general equilibrium models developed for the economies of the Ivory Coast, Turkey, and Yugoslavia are being transferred to those countries for their continuing use and application by researchers there trained by Bank staff."
1983,"The importance of designing policies that permit developing countries to cope more effectively with fluctuations and adverse trends in the international environment has prompted the research program to look at wider issues in international trade, particularly those surrounding impediments to trade in services and labor migration. The impact of migrating labor on host and beneficiary economies continues to be investigated."
1983,"In August 1982, the Executive Directors authorized a new short-term borrowing program, with a $1.5 billion ceiling on notes outstanding. The notes could have maturities of up to one year. The objectives were to achieve additional financial flexibility by gaining access to the growing market for short-term instruments and its diverse customers and to reduce the overall cost of funds through lower-cost borrowings in that market. The IBRD's first short-term notes were sold in the United States market on September 29, 1982, and the ceiling was reached within a month. The IBRD's short-term notes have been widely accepted as a premier credit and generally have been sold and traded competitively within the price range for the highest quality short-term securities. The IBRD's average cost of short-term note borrowings was about 250 basis points lower than the cost of the planned alternative—intermediate-term US-dollar borrowings—and in late April, 1983, the Executive Directors raised the authorized ceiling to $2.0 billion. On June 30. 1983. outstanding short-term notes totaled $1.5 billion."
1983,"The IBRD does not trade in any currencies for its own account. Adjustments arising from translation of currencies to US-dollar equivalents do not result in realized gains or losses as would occur with actual conversions into US dollars. Because of this, the General Reserve, rather than net income, is charged or credited annually with the amount of adjustment resulting from currency depreciations or appreciations. In fiscal 1983. the translation of currencies into US-dollar equivalents resulted in a debit to the General Reserve of S191 million, compared with $279 million debited in fiscal 1982. (A more detailed explanation is provided in the ""Notes to Financial Statements."")"
1983,"By and large, the agricultural sector has continued to display the same adverse trends during the early 1980s that characterized it throughout the previous decade. Drought, which in 1982 particularly affected Botswana, Ethiopia, Lesotho. Zambia, and Zimbabwe, was superimposed on an underlying weak situation of long standing. For example, producer prices have not kept pace with inflation in many countries, thereby prolonging the downward trend in the terms of trade of farmers that took place throughout the 1970s. Marketing arrangements have also tended to undermine incentives. In addition, the acute scarcity of foreign exchange has made it difficult for governments to ensure sufficient supplies of imported fertilizer, pesticides, and spare parts, thereby reducing the impact on production of such policy reforms as have taken place."
1983,"The foreign-exchange constraint was relieved, to some extent, by a reduction in petroleum and food prices but, on balance, the terms of trade of the region continued to deteriorate significantly. The index number of the commoditv terms of trade fell from 100 in 1978-80 to 81 in 1981, and to 75 in 1982. Terms of trade in 1982 were 36 percent below the average of the entire decade of the 1970s. Some recovery is expected during the period ahead, but it is very likely that, for the whole of this decade, the terms of trade of the Eastern and Southern African countries will remain far worse than during the 1970s."
1983,"These policy initiatives in the energy field are encouraging. In this sector, as in others reviewed earlier in this chapter, the policy-reform process has just begun. Implementation has been slow, uneven, and far short of what is required. Much remains to be done in agriculture and public finance, as well as in industrial and trade policy, parastatal efficiency, and resource mobilization. The Bank has supported policy reform through increased technical and financial assistance; in fiscal 1983, IBRD and IDA commitments were at record levels in terms of both amounts and the number of projects approved."
1983,"Because of the sharp decrease in foreign-exchange earnings, countries of the region have experienced persistent and often widening trade deficits on current account—with Cameroon and Gabon the only notable exceptions. As a pro-"
1983,"ance. Medium-term and long-term indebtedness, however, is low; the country, therefore, is likely to borrow heavily in 1983, possibly through some combination of medium-term refinancing from foreign banks of part of the arrears on trade payments, through borrowings from other countries that are members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), and through additional Eurodollar borrowing."
1983,"In Ivory Coast, structural-adjustment policies continued to be pursued with determination. The IBRD's first structural-adjustment loan (of $150 million) in support of the government's initiation of a stabilization plan was fully disbursed early in 1983. As a result of the continuing adverse external environment, further declines in the country's terms of trade were registered: GDP declined in real terms by 1.8 percent in 1982. The government's response was to move swiftly to strengthen and intensify its structural-adjustment program. It adopted a bold and forceful package of policy reforms designed to promote growth, improve productivity, and generate public savings. Measures include reforms in investment programming, in public enterprises, and in agricultural incentives. New features of adjustment include a major restructuring of the system of industrial incentives and protection and reform of the costly public-housing scheme. In support of this program, a second IBRD loan (for $281 million) was negotiated at the end of fiscal 1983."
1983,"The three neighboring countries of Guinea. Sierra Leone, and Liberia all suffered further decreases in their terms of trade in fiscal 1983 and recorded either stagnation or further declines in their per capita incomes. Through various policy changes, the governments of all three countries have attempted to adjust to their reduced prospects. In Guinea, the government alleviated, to some extent, the extreme shortage of foreign exchange by legalizing imports that are financed through the parallel market for foreign exchange. This measure followed that which legalized the private marketing of locally produced food at market-determined prices. Agricultural exports at the official exchange rate, however, continue to be very limited—less than 5 percent of the level of two decades ago."
1983,"Since exports account for a third of GDP. Senegal is highly vulnerable to changes in its terms of trade. For example, when, in late 1982. the world prices of groundnut products—which normally account for about a quarter of export revenues—fell to their lowest level, in real terms, since the 1930s, the country's overall terms of trade fell 10 percent. Foreign-exchange earnings were so reduced that scheduled debt-service payments would have risen from around 14 percent of export receipts in 1981/82 to 33 percent in 1982/83 had not a second round of debt rescheduling taken place following agreement with the IMF on a stand-by arrangement. Balance-of-payments support was also provided by France, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, and Saudi Arabia. For its part, the government has made a number of difficult adjustments. To bring about a measure of fiscal balance, consumer subsidies on cooking oil, wheat flour, sugar, and, above all, rice have been decreased; the price of rice was raised, successfully, by 31 percent. Reform of public enterprises is continuing (to eliminate deficits, a number of public firms recently increased their tariffs). The International Development Association is assisting the country's reform program through an ongoing technical-assistance project, which was approved in fiscal year 1981."
1983,"The impact of the sharply deteriorating external environment in 1982 is perhaps most clearly illustrated in the case of the Philippines. Its real rate of growth, as measured by the gross domestic product (GDP), slowed to 2.5 percent in 1982, about a third of the rate achieved in 1978-79, with the main decline being experienced in the rate of industrial growth. Both investment and exports fell sharply. The country's real income was reduced by further adverse movements in the terms of trade, which worsened by about 25 percent during the period 1979-82; the deterioration in 1982, alone, was 8 percent."
1983,"more than 4 percent. However, economic expansion and a current-account deficit in the balance-of-payments anticipated to be in the amount of S2 billion will depend, to a considerable extent, upon an increase in the volume of exports of just under 10 percent, some improvement in the terms of trade, and on a growth in imports of no more than 9 percent. While this is certainly within the realm of possibility, continuing economic sluggishness of Korea's major trading partners among the industrial countries would make the export target a difficult one to achieve; growth, therefore, may have to be sustained by domestic demand—as it has been for the past year. As a consequence, the balance-of-payments deficit could be somewhat larger than is currently projected."
1983,"Thailand has also been adjusting to the adverse world conditions. By international comparison, its GDP growth—at about 4 percent—was above average in 1982. but the economy suffered a sharp deterioration in its external terms of trade. Inflation was greatly reduced, and consumer prices increased by only 5 percent during the year. Low-investment and destocking of inventories resulted in substantially lower imports, while exports, on the other hand, continued to grow—albeit at a pace slower than in previous years. This confluence of events resulted in a current-account deficit in the balance of payments that was lower than in recent years, falling to 3 percent of GDP in 1982. down from 7 percent the year before. Thus, with continued, though reduced, growth in GDP. lower inflation, and a significant reduction in the current-account deficit. Thailand weathered the international recession of 1982 quite well, except for a considerable deterioration in public-sector savings. The budget deficit in 1982 was about 4 percent of GDP. or roughly twice the amount budgeted, and was largely the result of shortfalls in revenue. These shortfalls were the result of lower inflation, less domestic activity, and fewer imports."
1983,"The prolonged world recession has caused a sharp reversal in Indonesia's current-account balance. In both fiscal 1980 and 1981, the country enjoyed a current-account surplus in excess of $2 billion, with oil and liquid natural gas accounting for about two-thirds of export earnings. Only two years ago. the outlook was for continuing, large surpluses throughout the early part of the 1980s, and medium-term development plans were drawn up based upon that expectation. But in fiscal 1982. the volume of oil exports fell, world demand for other export commodities, such as rubber, timber, tin, and coffee, softened, and Indonesia's nonoil terms of trade deteriorated substantially—by about 25 percent from their level of 1979. As the world recession intensified and oil prices weakened, the current-account deficit of $2.8 billion (in fiscal 1982) increased to almost $7 billion in fiscal 1983. equivalent to approximately 8 percent of GNP for that year."
1983,"The experience of Malaysia has been similar to that of Indonesia. Although less dependent upon oil exports, it has been extremely hard hit by the fall in the world prices of tin and rubber, two of its principal commodity exports. As prices of imports did not lessen, the terms of trade worsened by 20 percent in the period, calendar 198082. after rising by 40 percent during the previous five years. With worsening terms of trade, the balance-of-payments position has changed dramatically. From a situation of current-account surpluses, there has been a shift to deficits, amounting to 10 percent of GNP in 1981 and 13 percent in 1982."
1983,"Papua New Guinea, a moderate-sized country in terms of population, experienced a fall in the value of its exports of 10 percent in 1982. which followed a 22 percent drop in 1981. Its two most important products, copper concentrates (including gold) and coffee, together account for 60 percent of total exports. In 1982. exports of the former fell in value by one-third; coffee fared as badly. A decline in the terms of trade, equivalent to 15 percent of GDP over the period 198182. was also registered. Since exports are the primary source of incomes and government revenues, a severe strain has been placed on the country's development efforts. The government reacted to straitened circumstances bv reducing public expenditures by 5 percent in real terms, and targeting cuts in public-service employment by 3,000, or about 6 percent of the total."
1983,"Although the pace of growth slackened and balance-of-payments deficits— accentuated by weakening terms of trade—remained of concern, the toll that might otherwise have been taken by the recession was eased by the countries' domestic policies, as well as by foreign assistance, which, to most countries of the region, was maintained at. or exceeded, levels of the previous year, although, in some cases, it was on harder terms. As a consequence of the assistance received on concessional terms in the past and of their own prudent debt-management policies."
1983,"Bank financial assistance to promote adjustment has been supplemented by technical assistance that, in some instances, has been closely associated with lending. A broad range of macro and sector-adjustment policy issues was analyzed in economic reports, which were discussed with countries' policymakers. In-depth analyses of issues in the energy sector—including ways to promote energy production and conservation, and examination of long-term development requirements—have been undertaken, and the results discussed with governments in a number of countries (for example, Bangladesh, Nepal. Pakistan, and Sri Lanka). To assist governments in.expanding exports, trade-policy issues have been the subject of extensive examination in Bangladesh. Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. As a rule, these analyses have been carried out jointly by governments and the Bank."
1983,"nomic-management policies (primarily a blend of domestic procurement and distribution efforts and timely efforts to import 4.5 million tons of wheat) were able to mitigate this and some other adverse effects of the drought. Despite the need to import agricultural products to offset lower levels of domestic production, the total volume of imports grew by less than 1 percent, thanks to significant gains in domestic production of cement, fertilizer, and other basic goods. Coupled with growth in the volume of exports of about 5 percent and a slight improvement in terms of trade, India's balance-of-payments position improved in fiscal 1983. The current-account deficit, which had been $3.8 billion and 2.5 percent of GDP in fiscal 1982, declined to $3.4 billion and to 2.2 percent of GDP."
1983,"The global recession and poor harvests have both contributed to Bangladesh's recent economic difficulties. The international recession severely affected export demand for, and prices of, raw jute and jute goods and of other important exports and led to a 35 percent decline in the terms of trade between fiscal 1980 and fiscal 1982. During the same period, inflows of aid stagnated. Since these inflows finance about half of total imports, and since import-based taxes provide 60 percent of government revenues, the government's ability to finance both imports and its development budget was reduced. In addition, a series of poor crops, caused by drought, necessitated substantial imports of food grains on commercial terms (further straining a weak balance of payments), reduced rural incomes"
1983,"A continuation of the government's recent policies should help to place the Bangladesh economy on a footing that would permit it to benefit from an international economic recovery. However, the scope for increasing exports in the short term is limited, although export incentives are being progressively increased. Special emphasis is also being placed on the production of food grains and fertilizers, the substitution of imported petroleum by domestic natural gas, increasing the role of the private sector in economic activity, and on devising a new trade and industrial policy to foster efficient industrialization. Nevertheless, the balance-of-payments and budgetary outlook for the next few years will remain tight, and unless external-resource inflows are substantially increased, overall growth of investment and economic activity will be adversely affected."
1983,"Despite several adverse circumstances—and especially the world recession—Pakistan's real GDP is projected to grow at about 6.2 percent in fiscal 1983, equaling the mark achieved in the previous year. In contrast, both balance-of-payments and budgetary positions have deteriorated, largely as a result of the slowdown in the world economy and falling commodity prices. Mainly as the result of the depressed state of the world rice and cotton markets, exports have been sharply lower in the past two years. Pakistan's balance-of-payments situation, as fiscal year 1983 drew to a close, remained manageable, however. Contributory factors were improvements in world trade and commodity prices late in the year, the favorable effect on migrant remittances and a number of minor exports of adjustments in the value of the rupee, and the continued flow of resources from the IMF's Extended Fund and Compensatory Financing Facilities. Despite the 17 percent increase in its external indebtedness since 1978, debt servicing is not as"
1983,"Supported by an Extended Fund Facility arrangement and a structural-adjustment credit from IDA, tighter demand-management and supply-side measures have been adopted to promote structural adjustment and to increase efficiency and production in those key sectors that can contribute to better balance-of-payments performance. In agriculture, producer prices have been raised to bring them more in line with international prices. Subsidies on fertilizers and herbicides have been reduced, while efforts have been made to increase the supply of inputs and the availability of credit. Investment is being increasingly directed towards rehabilitation of the irrigation system and improvement of water conservation and of drainage facilities in waterlogged and saline areas. Water charges have also been increased to defray higher operational and maintenance costs. In industry, steps have been taken to improve the climate for the private sector through constitutional guarantees against arbitrary nationalization, tax and trade incentives, and simplified investment-sanctioning procedures. To reorient the trade regime towards exports, incentives for exports have been increased and a program of phased import liberalization initiated. In the field of energy, government initiatives include a strengthening of energy-planning, encouragement of private-sector participation in energy development (through increases in producer prices for oil and gas to encourage increased exploration and development), and increases in consumer prices of oil and gas to encourage conservation."
1983,"Nepal's economic performance continues to be heavily influenced by the weather and by international demand for its exports. Good harvests in 1981 and 1982 resulted in real GDP growth of between 4 percent and 5 percent in those years. Increased agricultural output, in turn, usually results in strong export gains (as in 1981). particularly of food grains. In 1982, however, despite another sharp increase in rice exports, total export earnings remained at the previous year's level as a result of a decline in jute and nontraditional exports (hides, skins, handicrafts). Thus, despite a substantial slowdown in the growth of imports, Nepal's trade deficit widened further to 10.2 percent of GDP in 1982. As in previous years, about two-fifths of this deficit was offset by net earnings from tourism, other services, and remittances; further increases in foreign grants and concessional loans resulted in an overall balance-of-payments surplus. Nepal's external debt is currently less than 10 percent of gross domestic product, and its annual debt-service ratio is less than 2 percent of GDP. To address its weakening trade balance, the government last year enacted a new trade policy aimed at promoting exports, substituting imports, and rationalizing trade."
1983,"increasing restrictions on international trade, and difficult conditions in the international financial markets as interest rates rose and private capital flows decreased substantially. Simultaneously, earlier domestic economic policies, which led to public-sector imbalance and uneconomic investments, have reinforced the need for adjustment. While in a number of countries the medium-term adjustment process may be well in place and is already bearing its first fruits, in others, only the first beginnings have been set in motion. With only a modest near-term recovery foreseen for the more developed economies, the task of adjustment is likely to continue to be a difficult one."
1983,"For several years, Egypt has benefited from an unprecedented growth in revenue from petroleum exports, earnings from the Suez Canal, emigrant remittances, and tourist receipts; yearly growth in gross domestic product (GDP) averaged over 8 percent. In 1982, however, as a result of the impact of the international recession on these sources of earnings, the country's current-account deficit widened to nearly 14 percent of GDP, its fiscal deficit reached 22 percent of GDP, and growth in GDP slowed. Inflation was at an officially estimated annual rate of 17 percent. Although a large proportion of capital inflows remains concessional, the burden of debt-service payments has increased moderately—to about 21 percent of the value of goods-and-services exports in fiscal year 1982. While some corrective measures have been taken to address this adverse turn of events, more comprehensive policy reforms are needed to help the economy sustain rapid economic growth and provide for increased employment. The policies should be designed to exploit more fully the economic potential of Egypt and should comprise measures aimed at increased mobilization of domestic resources, trade policies to encourage more rapid export growth and economically justified import"
1983,"phosphates—a principal export—was complicated by sharp increases in energy prices, in interest rates on international capital markets, and in imports of cereals induced by a severe drought in 1981. Growth in GDP, which had fallen to 4 percent a year during the period 1978-80, turned negative in 1981 and then recovered in 1982 (owing primarily to a good harvest). External debt service has increasingly become burdensome, despite increased access to concessional assistance since 1980. Additional adjustment measures, focusing on reducing the budgetary and external-account deficits, rationalizing the investment program of the public sector, redesigning trade policies to provide greater export incentives, and reducing distortions in the price system remain to be taken. The Bank's lending program supports such adjustment measures and emphasizes directly productive projects in agriculture, export promotion, efficient development of domestic energy resources, and education."

1983,"At the start of the decade, Yugoslavia introduced a series of economic-stabilization measures to correct its deteriorating external-accounts situation. Aggregate demand was compressed, and GDP growth fell to 1.5 percent in 1981 and 0.5 percent in 1982; real investment levels fell in both years. With these stabilization measures in hand, the current-account deficit was reduced from $1.8 billion in 1980 to $750 million in 1981, and to less than $100 million in 1982. In addition to the exchange-rate policies and interest-rate policies already introduced, it is anticipated that further initiatives will be taken during calendar 1983 in the areas of trade policy, investment rationalization, and demand management. (This adjustment process is being supported by a concerted response of the Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the international financial community, which negotiated a package of financial support early in 1983 to assist Yugoslavia through its short-term problem of external financial liquidity.) These policies, which form part of the country's medium-term adjustment program, should provide a firm basis on which the economy can establish a sustainable rate of economic growth."

1983,"The newest Bank member in the region, Hungary, is among those middle-income countries that are implementing a multifaceted program of economic adjustment that aims at harmonizing the growth of aggregate demand and resource availabilities to the changed external economic environment. The program's components are being implemented within a longer-term policy framework that is characterized by a greater reliance on prices, reduction of subsidies, macro-economic policy signals to guide economic decisionmaking, a broadening of participation in international trade, and an increase in the managerial and financial autonomy of enterprises. The combination of a modest (about 2 percent) growth of GDP in 1982 (led by a good harvest) and restraints and cutbacks in consumption and investment resulted in a deficit in Hungary's convertible-currency current account of only about $100 million in 1982; the account is projected to show a surplus of around $500 million in calendar 1983. External debt is anticipated to lessen slightly and its maturity structure to lengthen. During this first year of Hungary's membership in the IBRD, a comprehensive report on the economy was completed, and two loans, one for industrial restructuring and the other to support agricultural mechanization and grain storage, were approved by the Executive Directors."

1983,"The sharp deceleration of growth in the industrial countries since 1980. together with Latin America's increased interdependence with the world economy (and consequent greater vulnerability to external shocks), resulted in the deteriorating external position and slowdown of growth that has occurred in most countries in the region since 1980. High real rates of interest in international capital markets, declining demand for their exports in industrial countries, collapse of newly developed markets in some oil-exporting countries outside the region, severely depressed prices for major export commodities (copper, lead, nickel, silver, and tin among metals and coffee, wheat, sugar, soybeans, corn, and fishmeal among foodstuffs), increased protection in several important trading partners, and a decline in intra-Latin American trade operated to reduce growth in all Latin American countries. While the entire region experienced difficulties in 1982 as a consequence of the adverse external environment, some of the problems could have been influenced, to a certain extent, by domestic policies and the unique circumstances of each country."
1983,Decline of Trade
1983,"One of the most striking changes that occurred in Latin America during the past year was the decline in the region's international trade. During the 1970s, expansion of trade provided many of the countries in Latin America an avenue for growth, industrialization, and diversification of their economies. Export earnings grew rapidly in that decade compared with the rest of the developing world. Sustained expansion of exports provided the resources to acquire the imported goods and technology essential for sustaining accelerated investment, technological innova-"

Latin America's merchandise trade balance moved from deficit in 1981 to a surplus of $9 billion in 1982. However, an explosive rise in factor payments abroad, the result of higher interest payments on external borrowing, absorbed most (80 percent) of the additional resources generated by a strengthened trade balance. Factor payments abroad doubled from 1980 to 1982 and are now equivalent to 40 percent of exports. The net result of these large swings in the components of the current account was a reduc-"
1983,"The flow of external resources to Latin American countries accelerated the pace at which these countries have achieved their development objectives. Expansion of resources provided the basis for the rapid growth of the region's trade with the rest of the world, which occurred during the past decade and which itself required increased financing from abroad in the form of short-term, self-liquidating trade credits. From the longer-term developmental perspective, the countries of Latin America will continue to be net capital importers for the foreseeable future."
1983,"As noted, following the first round of oil-price increases and the world recession of the mid-1970s, most Latin American countries that were in a position to do so, borrowed abroad to ease adjustment to the deteriorating external environment. The countries that were most successful in sustaining the impetus of development in the face of these external shocks simultaneously expanded investment, output, employment, and trade. This expansion required that appropriate export, savings, investment, and production incentives (including pricing policies) be adopted to ensure adequate mobilization of domestic savings and the desired allocation of resources."
1983,"• that any recession in the industrial countries and disruption of world trade would be of short duration (that is, disruption would follow the pattern of previous recessions that had occurred in the post-World War II period);"
1983,"Concurrently, there have been changes in the external environment faced by most countries in the region that, if they persist, will make these liquidity problems more manageable. First, nominal interest rates in the Eurocurrency market have declined sharply since mid-1982. The six percentage-point decline in the London Interbank rate that has occurred since mid-1982 reduced the interest payments of Argentina. Brazil, and Mexico by S7 billion annually (or 26 percent of total interest payments that would have been due in 1982 had there been no drop in rates). Second, current-account deficits in the balance of payments of most Latin American countries declined in 1982 and are continuing to decline. Third, there is now evidence in the industrial countries of a resumption of economic growth, which is expected to lead to a resurgence of world trade. Recovery is by no means certain, however, and it is now more important than before"
1983,"Nevertheless, the problems that Latin American countries face in the short-term are formidable. It is likely that the achievement of developmental objectives will have be delayed. The liquidity problems that these countries are facing are expected to continue for some time. Over the medium term, however, these problems should prove manageable—provided economic health is restored on a worldwide basis, expansion of international trade is resumed, and the countries of the region implement and sustain policies that increase domestic savings, promote and diversify exports, improve allocative efficiency, enhance public-sector financial viability, and improve income distribution."

1983,"In Portugal, growth in GDP of 3.3 percent in 1982 far outstripped the average for the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). However, this growth was accompanied by a substantial worsening of the current-account deficit. Inflation continued at a relatively high rate of about 22 percent, and the budget deficit of the public sector is expected to be at about the level, as a percentage of GDP, of 1982. This fiscal imbalance, to a large extent, has resulted from interest increases on the accumulated public debt, as well as from transfers to public-sector enterprises. The relatively large proportion (about 30 percent) of the country's external debt with near-term maturities further complicates the readjustment process, although the government is making considerable efforts to reduce this proportion. The government has moved to restore the escudo to an appropriate level through devaluation measures, to adjust domestic prices of important commodities, and adjustments in administrative prices have started to be implemented as a means of reducing subsidies, thus contributing to the reduction of the public-sector deficit. Domestic interest rates have been raised to generally positive real levels, and other monetary and fiscal policies have been tightened. The authorities face a substantial challenge in correcting this deterioration in the internal economic situation at a time of slow world economic growth. Simultaneously, major restructuring efforts have assumed a sense of urgency as Portugal moves to join the European Communities in the near future."
1997,"In addition to the meetings and committee work, groups of executive directors and alternate executive directors at times make special trips to borrowing countries to observe Bank-supported operations and its assistance strategy firsthand. They meet with a wide range of people, including staff of the Bank’s resident missions or field offices, government officials, project managers, ngos and project beneficiaries, and the business community.

The fiscal year witnessed support for innovative projects such as the regional Lake Victoria environment project in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, the Solar Home System project in Indonesia, and India’s Ecodevelopment project. The Bank supported natural resource management in forested areas in Argentina, Haiti, and Mexico and general environmental management in India, Madagascar, and Sri Lanka. It also helped these and other developing countries move toward more flexible and cost-effective environmental policies and to develop innovative market-based instruments to promote environmental sustainability. Market-based instruments such as effluent charges, deposit-refund schemes, performance bonds, and tradable permits are all being utilized by Bank clients. Countries as diverse as China, the Czech Republic, and Mexico are basing their policies and investment plans on careful cost-effectiveness analysis with Bank support. And client countries are creating more attractive business climates for private investment in environmental projects as well as reducing subsidies and pricing distortions to free up resources for investment.

The region faces rapid urbanization, formalization of labor markets, and an aging population, all raising new challenges and posing new risks as people’s earlier informal ways of supporting the sick, disabled, unemployed, and elderly fall into decline and the need for formal mechanisms increases.

Its interventions include providing student assistance and secure boarding facilities for girls and providing female principals as role models. Indonesia’s Secondary Education Project is targeting rural areas and includes alternative schooling models that allow more poor children and girls to continue their education beyond the elementary level. Health projects also targeted the poorest.

Unless environmental protection becomes a higher policy priority, the costs of ill health and declining well-being that result from pollution will inhibit economic growth. In fiscal 1997 the Bank addressed such problems with support to both China and Indonesia to reverse industrial and urban pollution as well as to address concerns of potential loss of biodiversity. And in Indonesia, the Bali Urban Infrastructure Project includes an innovative component to protect Bali’s unique cultural heritage through strengthening conservation capacity and implementing pilot conservation projects, establishing"

State enterprise reform and financial sector development are especially important in China, Mongolia, and Vietnam. State-directed lending, political pressures, and poor lending practices are still common in the region, and— relative to their income level—-many countries have institutionally poorly developed banking systems. Solving these structural problems and building more robust banking systems are important throughout the region. The Bank is providing policy advice and technical assistance as well as lending services to many East Asia countries to help build and sustain efficient institutions. An example is the new partnership initiated this year with the government of Singapore. Under this partnership, managed by edi, courses in strategic banking and environmental management are provided to clients from East and South Asia, using Singaporean technical and financial resources. The banking course is designed specifically for China’s most senior bank officials and is offered at the Singapore Institute of Banking and Finance. It will be followed by a round of training for other senior banking officials in China itself.

Although this highlighted some structural issues, it mostly reflected one-off, or cyclical events, and the successful cooling of overheated economies rather than an end to sustained economic growth. Indeed, exports and overall economic growth recovered in the first half 1997, albeit below past levels.

Thus, for growth to be inclusive, a multipronged approach to create jobs in selected sectors while enhancing the quality of employment, especially labor income, in others must be implemented."
2008,"The Bank Group launched a series of global consultations with stakeholders to help formulate a Strategic Framework on Climate Change and Development by the end of 2008. This framework will outline the organization's integrated approach to the issue. The Bank had already set goals for piloting adaptation instruments and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by increasing lending for clean energy while also significantly increasing access to electricity, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Overall, Bank lending for energy rose to $4.2 billion in fiscal 2008, and the share of low-carbon projects in the Bank's energy portfolio grew to about 40 percent.

2008,"It would reduce the distortions in agricultural trade created by decades of subsidies by developed countries and import barriers by both developed and developing countries. The Doha agreement would increase incentives to invest in agricultural markets—including in low-income countries—and in the long run would help reduce the chance of future global food price crises. Overall, the agreement would provide a more supportive international framework for developing countries, especially the world's poorest, as they seek to improve their trade performance; integrate into the world economy; and achieve more rapid, sustainable, and inclusive economic growth.

These partnerships promote collaboration in areas of common concern such as combating communicable diseases, preserving the environment, fostering agricultural research, acquiring and sharing knowledge, integrating trade, addressing international migration issues, and developing infrastructure. The Bank is also continuing its work with development partners on cooperative measures that minimize the cost of delivering aid and thereby increase aid effectiveness. The Bank currently participates in some 194 global and regional partnerships; nearly $187 million from the Bank's own resources has been disbursed in fiscal 2008 to support global and regional partnerships as of the end of fiscal 2008."
2008,"The Bank Group increasingly undertakes innovative joint initiatives. One of the farthest-reaching is a regional integration assistance strategy for Sub-Saharan Africa that seeks to strengthen collaboration among the region’s countries with a focus on cross-border challenges: infrastructure; economic cooperation and harmonization; and regional approaches for addressing climate change, agricultural productivity, shared water resources, and health."

2009,"The region's middle-income countries—China, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand—were able to withstand the initial wave of impacts because of the structural reforms implemented after the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis. But the collapse in global demand and the sharp contraction in exports and industrial production now have affected every country in the region. Especially hard hit have been countries that depend heavily on the manufacture and export of electronics (the Philippines), commodities (Indonesia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Mongolia, Papua New Guinea, and Timor-Leste), and garments (Cambodia and the Pacific Island economies)."
2009,"A number of countries acted early to strengthen social protection measures. China made a one-time cash payment to 74 million poor people, including millions of rural residents, and introduced a major health reform package aimed at increasing poor people's access to health care. Indonesia strengthened a targeted cash assistance program for the poor, and the Philippines put a conditional cash transfer program in place."
2009,"Exactly a month after the devastating May 2008 earthquake in Wenchuan, which killed almost 70,000 people, the government of China and the Bank organized an international workshop on international good practice in reconstruction.

A total of 79 countries were eligible for IDA assistance in fiscal 2009. To date, 27 countries have graduated from IDA. Some IDA recipients, most recently China and the Arab Republic of Egypt, have now become IDA donors. The allocation of IDA's resources is determined primarily by each recipient's rating in the annual Country Policy and Institutional Assessments. In the case of countries that are eligible for both IDA and IBRD funds, IDA allocations must also take into account those countries' creditworthiness for and access to other sources of funds."
2009,"IDA is financed largely by contributions from donor governments (figure 3.9). Additional financing includes transfers from IBRD's net income, grants from IFC, and borrowers' repayment of earlier IDA credits. Every three years, donor governments and representatives of borrower countries meet to discuss IDA's policies and priorities and to agree on the amount of new resources required to fund its lending program over the following three fiscal years. Historically, the major industrial nations have been the largest contributors to IDA, but donor nations also include developing countries and transition economies—some of them current IBRD borrowers and former IDA borrowers. Six new countries joined the donor community during the IDA15 negotiations: China, Cyprus, Egypt, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania."
2009,"Latin America and the Caribbean received the highest share of IBRD's new lending commitments, with $ 13.8 billion (42 percent of total IBRD commitments), followed by Europe and Central Asia, which received $9 billion (27 percent) in funding, and East Asia and Pacific, which received $6.9 billion (21 percent). Lending was less concentrated than in fiscal 2008. Whereas the largest five countries received roughly 53 percent of total lending in fiscal 2008, five countries, including Brazil, China, Indonesia, Mexico, and Poland received combined commitments of 49 percent of total IBRD lending in fiscal 2009."
2009,"Under certain circumstances, IBRD would be able to continue to lend to a borrower that was reaching the single borrower exposure limit by entering into an arrangement that would prevent its net exposure from exceeding the limit. Any such arrangement would need to be approved in advance by IBRD's Executive Directors. As of June 30, 2009 IBRD had entered into one such arrangement with China. As of this date, China had not reached the single borrower exposure limit and therefore, activation of this arrangement was not required."
2009,"To fill important gaps and attract donor support, we have launched the Capitalization Fund to help strengthen banks in smaller emerging markets, and a microfinance facility that will support lending to as many as 60 million poor borrowers in many of the world's poorest countries.

2009,"Banks and investment companies in the region were not large holders of subprime mortgage-backed securities, and many Gulf countries were in a strong enough financial position to cushion the large outflows of short-term capital in the second half of 2008. Nonetheless, the global financial crisis affected the financing outlook in the region. Spreads on sovereign debt increased, regional stock market indices suffered sizable declines, foreign direct investment inflows are expected to weaken, export revenues and tourism and trade-related services are declining, and remittances are expected to contract."
2009,"Oil-exporting countries with large populations, such as Algeria, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Libya, the Syrian Arab Republic, and the Republic of Yemen entered the crisis with weaker fiscal and current account balances than the Gulf Cooperation Council countries. They also have larger social commitments, such as subsidies, which make it difficult for them to reduce expenditures during a downturn. Non-oil exporting countries such as Djibouti, Jordan, and Lebanon, which are economically linked to the Gulf countries, will experience declines in tourism, remittances, and foreign direct investment from the Gulf countries. In addition, some migrant workers may return home, which will add to social pressures. Countries with strong trade links to Europe (Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia) may suffer more from the crisis than other countries in the region, because lower European demand stifles exports, tourism, remittances, foreign direct investment, and possibly foreign assistance. Job losses by exporters will increase human strife. In the past, these countries have tapped international financial markets to finance their current account deficits—which may be difficult to do in the current environment."
2009,increasing trade financing and guaranteeing foreign direct investment
2009,"During fiscal 2009, IFC scaled up its trade finance program and expanded its technical assistance and advisory services to private investors. For its part, MIGA plans to use its guarantee facility to help secure foreign direct investment in client countries in the Middle East and North Africa."
2009,"The ongoing financial crisis is increasing the need for Bank services for middle-income countries. IBRD is able to help these countries deal with these challenges. The financial crisis, which originated in the developed world, threatens to disrupt middle-income countries' strong growth performance and risks considerably slowing efforts to reduce poverty. The effect of the crisis is twofold: first, middle-income countries are facing difficult credit-market conditions, with limited access to capital markets, shorter maturity access, and higher interest rate spreads; and second, the growing worldwide downturn has led to collapsing growth; escalating unemployment; and declining trade, commodity prices, tourism, remittances, and investment. The Bank is responding vigorously through analytical work and lending, with crisis response and precautionary elements focused on capital market access, social safety nets, and sustaining infrastructure expenditures."
2009,"In fiscal 2009, the Bank's research group addressed vital development issues within its core research programs on macroeconomics and growth; trade and integration; finance and the private sector; poverty and inequality; human development and public services; agriculture and rural development; and environment and energy. Surveys show that outside researchers and the policy community use the group's research findings and data and software products to understand development issues and access key information and analytic capacity."
2009,"Research related to the crisis was understandably in high demand in fiscal 2009. New crisis research concerned international capital flows; trade and migration responses; social spending responses; and impacts on poverty and human development. The group's research has identified both successes and failures in policy responses to past crises, and has pointed to concrete actions that developing countries can take to address the current crisis, including protecting their poor, without damaging long-term development prospects."
2009,"helped users monitor poverty, evaluate public programs, assess trade and financial regulations, and measure governance."

2009,"As of June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008, all of IBRD’s investment securities were held in a trading portfolio. Where available, quoted market prices are used to determine the fair value of trading securities. Examples include some government securities, mutual funds, futures and exchange-traded equity securities. For instruments for which market quotations are not available, fair values are determined using model-based valuation techniques, whether internally-generated or vendor-supplied, that includes the standard discounted cash flow method using market observable inputs such as yield curves, credit spreads, and prepayment speeds. Unless quoted prices are available, money market instruments are reported at face value which approximates fair value."

2009,"Investment securities are classified based on management’s intention on the date of purchase, their nature, and IDA’s policies governing the level and use of such investments. At June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008, all investment securities were held in a trading portfolio. Investment securities and related financial instruments held in IDA’s trading portfolio are carried and reported at fair value. The first-in first-out (FIFO) method is used to determine the cost of securities sold in computing the realized gains and losses on these instruments. Unrealized gains and losses for investment securities and related financial instruments held in the trading portfolio are included in income. Derivative instruments are used in liquidity management to enhance investment returns and are not designated as hedging instruments. These derivatives are carried at fair value. IDA enters into forward contracts for the sale or purchase of investment securities; these transactions are recorded at the trade date."
